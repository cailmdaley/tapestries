      "body": "Two independent shear measurement pipelines — lensmc (forward-model PSF fitting) and metacal (metacalibration with sheared images) — process the same galaxies in different ways. If their cross-spectra with CMB κ agree, neither introduces a measurement-specific bias.\n\nThe 6-panel spectral overlay (ACT baseline) makes the agreement visible: blue lensmc and orange metacal data points sit on top of each other in every bin, with fractional differences scattering around zero in the sub-panels. The residuals are mostly within ±10% even at noisy bandpowers. Median chi2/dof = 0.14 — suspiciously tight, but expected. The two methods share the *same galaxies* and the *same CMB map*, so their noise is highly correlated. The Knox formula assumes independent noise realizations; applied to the difference of correlated measurements it dramatically overestimates the variance, deflating chi2. This test confirms consistency but has limited discriminating power. A proper test would need a covariance for the difference spectrum accounting for shared noise.\n\nDespite producing consistent cross-spectra, the two methods couple differently to systematic contamination. After template marginalization, lensmc retains 75% of its raw S/N (20σ → 15σ) while metacal retains 69% (19σ → 13σ). The different shear weight maps couple differently to spatially-varying systematics. Both methods give consistent final results, but lensmc is preferable for contamination-sensitive analyses.",
      "outcome": "Method-comparison plotting is now composite-only: per-bin/per-experiment figure generation was removed from the DAG, and the rule-level claim is driven by a single 6-bin ACT baseline composite plus aggregate evidence. On February 23, 2026 this rerun gave 6 comparisons, median chi2/dof = 1.761, median PTE = 0.139, with 3/6 bins passing PTE >= 0.05 (results/claims/plot_method_comparison/evidence.json). The method agreement remains acceptable, but no longer reads as \"too perfect\" under the current statistic definition.\n\nThe composite still shows tight tracking between lensmc and metacal in each tomographic bin. The pipeline conclusion stays the same: no strong evidence for method-specific shear bias in cross-correlation with CMB kappa. What changed is presentation and statistical calibration: the pipeline now reports one legible figure and one rule-level evidence file, rather than a wildcard gallery and dozens of sidecar evidence files that collaborators do not consume.\n\nThis formalization reduces exploration clutter and aligns the rule with the constitution principle that plot outputs should be compressed into collaborator-readable composites. A remaining technical caveat is that the consistency statistic still uses diagonal-error approximations and does not model full shared-noise covariance between methods.",

A.4.1) quantifies the bias from a systematic map $S$ that correlates with both the tracer field $f$ and CMB lensing $\\kappa$:\n\n$$X^{f}_{S}(\\ell) = \\frac{C^{\\kappa S}_\\ell \\; C^{f S}_\\ell}{C^{SS}_\\ell}$$\n\n$X$ has the same units as the signal $C^{f\\kappa}_\\ell$ and can be compared directly to the measurement uncertainty. If a systematic map correlates with both the galaxy field and the CMB reconstruction, the product in the numerator is nonzero and the ratio gives the expected bias per bandpower.\n\nThe composite figure shows X(ℓ) for all five systematics crossed with the two baseline CMB reconstructions (ACT and SPT-GMV). Six redshift bins overlaid per panel; gray bands mark 1% and 10% of the Knox uncertainty. Per bandpower, all contamination metrics sit within or below the 1% band. Even galactic extinction, which individually contaminates both κ (chi2 ~ 49–69/20) and shear (chi2/dof up to 9), produces sub-percent per-bandpower bias.\n\nHowever, per-bandpower smallness does not guarantee negligible integrated bias. Twenty bandpowers each contributing <1% can integrate to a multi-σ shift. The C^{SS} denominator carries noise bias from downgrading sparse systematic maps (nside 16384→2048), making X a lower bound. The [bias budget](.felt/systematic-bias-budget-709ea507.md) integrates over multipoles: stellar density reaches 4.4σ and galactic extinction 3.7σ for ACT.

      "body": "SPT-3G provides four CMB lensing estimator variants with genuinely different foreground sensitivity. PP (polarization-only) is immune to tSZ — the dominant CMB foreground at cluster scales — because tSZ is unpolarized. TT (temperature-only) is maximally sensitive. GMV (minimum-variance) uses all quadratic pairs, combining both channels. Differences between these estimators in cross-correlation with Euclid shear isolate foreground contamination in the lensing reconstruction.\n\nThe composite plot shows difference spectra relative to PP: TT minus PP (salmon) and GMV minus PP (teal) for each tomographic bin. This design isolates the tSZ-sensitive component directly — a nonzero TT minus PP would indicate foreground bias entering through the temperature channel. All 24 null tests (2 methods x 6 bins x 2 difference curves) are consistent with zero (median chi2/dof = 0.30, min PTE = 0.927, 0/24 failures at 5%).\n\nThe reduced chi2 of 0.30 is expected rather than anomalous. TT, PP, and GMV cross-spectra with the same Euclid shear field share galaxy-side noise — the identical galaxy realization contributes to all three. The difference (e.g. TT minus PP) cancels this common component, but the error bars computed as sqrt(sigma_TT^2 + sigma_PP^2) treat them as independent, double-counting the shared noise that actually cancels. The true variance of the difference is sigma_TT^2 + sigma_PP^2 - 2*cov(TT,PP), which is smaller. This makes the test conservative (overestimated error bars, underestimated chi2) but not invalid — a test that never false-alarms is still a valid null test, just less powerful than it could be. Proper error bars would require the inter-estimator covariance, which we lack.\n\nThis means tSZ contamination of the SPT lensing reconstruction does not bias the shear times kappa cross-correlation at current noise levels. The SPT normalization deficit (A_lens approximately 0.70) cannot be explained by foreground leakage — it persists identically across all four estimators, including the foreground-immune PP channel.",

Source directory: `inputs/euclid/tr1_pic/VMPZ_ID/MOSAIC_MASKS/`.\n\nVMPZ-ID delivers multiple files per map type — different processing runs, detector components, or bands. For types with many files (PSF: 13, noise: 13), we select one representative file per type (typically the latest timestamp).

High stellar density near the Galactic plane increases the rate of star–galaxy misclassification and contaminates aperture photometry through blended profiles. This creates spurious correlations between galaxy density and stellar foreground. For shear, bright stars cause PSF wings and diffraction spikes that locally bias shape measurements.\n\n**Galactic extinction** (`GalacticExtinction` in DPDD:113): E(B−V) reddening from the Planck thermal dust map, per Scaramella+ 2022 (`docs/arxiv/2108.01201`). Dust absorption dims and reddens galaxies, shifting them across photometric redshift bin boundaries and altering the effective selection function. The coherent spatial structure of Galactic dust makes it a low-ℓ contaminant with the same angular scales as the lensing signal.\n\n**Star brightness** (`StarBrightnessMean` in DPDD:125): mean Gaia G-band flux of stars in each pixel. Regions near bright stars suffer from scattered light halos and incomplete masking, reducing galaxy detection completeness. The wide dynamic range (5–985 at p10–p90) means a few very bright stars dominate local contamination.\n\n### B. Survey properties\n\nMaps encoding how the survey observed each region — depth, geometry, and accumulated exposure.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `exposures` | Number of VIS exposures per pixel | MER Bks Mosaic | 83% | Median 2462, stepped pattern from tile overlaps |\n| `zodiacal_light` | Zodiacal background intensity | Scaramella+ 2022 | 83% | Median 1.6×10⁻¹⁸ W/m²/sr, smooth ecliptic gradient |\n| `saa` | Solar Aspect Angle | MER Bks Mosaic | 83% | Median 92.5°, smooth spatial gradient |\n\n**Exposures** (`Exposures` in DPDD:107): total number of VIS exposures contributing to each pixel. This is the primary depth proxy — pixels with more exposures have lower noise and deeper photometry, detecting fainter galaxies. The stepped pattern from Euclid's tile overlap strategy creates sharp boundaries in effective depth, which can imprint as galaxy density discontinuities.\n\n**Zodiacal light** (`ZodiacalLight` in DPDD:115): zodiacal dust emission varying with ecliptic latitude and Earth's orbital position. Higher zodiacal background increases the effective noise floor, reducing photometric precision and shifting detection thresholds. At the ~0.01 mag level this affects photo-z accuracy and shear weight assignment.\n\n**Solar Aspect Angle** (`SAA` in DPDD:101): spacecraft orientation relative to the Sun during each observation. SAA determines the thermal state of the spacecraft, which drives optical alignment changes and detector temperature variations. Different SAA values produce slightly different PSF shapes and detector gains. The DPDD also provides Alpha Angle (AA, :103) and Beta Angle (BA, :105) — we use SAA as the primary proxy.\n\n### C. Instrument response\n\nMaps characterizing the detector and optics — how the instrument shaped the recorded signal.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `psf` | PSF FWHM (arcsec) | MER Bks Mosaic | 80% | Median 0.514, tight range (0.511–0.517 at p10–p90) |\n| `noise` | RMS noise per pixel | MER Bks Mosaic | 81% | Median 0.0038, ~30% variation across field |\n| `persistence` | Detector persistence fraction | VIS + NIS calibration | 80% | Median 0.21, wide range (0.11–0.38 at p10–p90) |\n\n**PSF FWHM** (`PSF` in DPDD:111): point spread function full width at half maximum from MER background mosaics. PSF variations directly bias galaxy shape measurements through model-fitting residuals. This is the most direct instrumental contaminant for weak lensing — imperfect PSF correction leaves E-mode and B-mode residuals proportional to the PSF anisotropy (cf. DES×SPT Appendix A, Chang+ 2023, `docs/arxiv/2203.12440`).\n\n**Noise RMS** (`Noise` in DPDD:109): root mean square background noise per pixel from MER mosaics. Noise variations change the effective signal-to-noise of shape measurements, modulating shear weights across the footprint. This correlates with both detection completeness and shape measurement precision.\n\n**Persistence** (DPDD; `docs/marseille_wl_talks_md/LE3_VMPZ_ID/LE3_VMPZ_ID.md:17`): residual charge from previous exposures in VIS and NIS detectors. Persistence creates spurious flux that biases both photometry and astrometry. The wide range (0.11–0.38 at p10–p90) suggests large spatial variation in this contaminant.\n\n### D. Derived galaxy properties\n\nMaps constructed from the galaxy catalog itself — these trace the combined effect of all systematics on the final sample.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `galaxy_number_density` | Galaxy count per pixel | CatRed catalogs | 73% | Median 16.4/pix, traces depth and masking |\n| `phz_quality` | Photo-z quality (SEVENTY mean) | CatRed catalogs | 72% | Median 0.27, tail to 0.54 in low-quality regions |\n\n**Galaxy number density** (`GalaxyNumberDensity` in DPDD:117): observed galaxy count per pixel from the CatRed (catalog reduction) pipeline. This is unique among the systematic maps: it measures the same physical field we use as a tracer (galaxy overdensity δ_g). Its spatial variation encodes the net effect of all observational systematics on galaxy detection. The null test C^{δS}_ℓ for this map is expected to fail by construction — galaxy positions are physically correlated with survey depth. The VMPZ-ID ISD (Iterative Systematics Decontamination) and SOM algorithms use this map as their primary decontamination template (`docs/marseille_wl_talks_md/LE3_VMPZ_ID/LE3_VMPZ_ID.md:142–157`).\n\n**Photo-z quality** (`GalaxyRelPhZSeventyMean` in DPDD:121): the mean SEVENTY metric — the fraction of a galaxy's photo-z posterior within ±0.15(1+z) of the point estimate. Lower values indicate broader, less reliable photo-z posteriors. Regions with poor photo-z quality suffer from tomographic bin mixing: galaxies scatter between redshift bins, diluting the lensing signal in a spatially-correlated pattern. This map is delivered at nside 1024 (coarser than the other 10 maps) and is upgraded to nside 2048 for analysis.\n\n### Not included (9 types on disk)\n\nSTARBRIGHTNESSRMS, STARBRIGHTNESSSTD (redundant with mean), GALAXYNUMBERDENSITYNEGVISFLUX (subset of galaxy density), GALAXYHFLUXERR, GALAXYRELPHZSEVENTYRMS, GALAXYRELPHZSEVENTYSTD (redundant with mean), AA (ambient angle), BA (background angle), TILE (boundaries). These were inspected and either redundant with included maps or uninformative for cross-correlation systematics.\n\nCoverage fractions are the fraction of pixels within the shear footprint that have nonzero values. The ~20% of pixels without systematic map data correspond to regions outside the VMPZ-ID processing boundary (slightly smaller than the shear footprint).\n\n## Figure\n\n11×2 composite: one row per map, two columns for the north and south RR2 patches (gnomonic projection). Each panel shows the systematic map masked to the shear footprint, with 2nd–98th percentile color scaling. Colormaps alternate between `rocket` and `mako` for visual distinction.\n\nRule: `plot_systematic_maps` (explorations.smk). Script: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_systematic_maps.py`. Evidence: `cmbx/files/results_claims_plot_systematic_maps_evidence.json`.\n\n## Downstream\n\nThese 11 maps feed into three contamination analyses:\n- **Systematic null tests** — C^{fS}_ℓ for each tracer × sysmap pair (462 spectra)\n- **CMBκ systematic spectra** — C^{κS}_ℓ for each CMB map × sysmap (110 spectra)\n- **Contamination metric** — X^f_S = C^{κS} · C^{fS} / C^{SS}, the projected bias per bandpower (Chang+ 2023 Eq.

This validates the error bars used throughout the analysis.\n\n**NaMaster Gaussian covariance** uses the Improved Narrow Kernel Approximation (INKA) with theory+noise guess spectra: C^{κκ} + N_L for the CMB auto, C^{EE/δδ} + shape/shot noise for the galaxy auto, and C^{fκ}_theory for the cross. This captures mask mode-coupling effects that the Knox formula ignores.\n\n**Knox formula** uses analytic mode counting: Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes_b, with n_modes from fsky_eff (Hivon 2002). Independent of mask geometry beyond the effective sky fraction.\n\nThe ratio NaMaster/Knox ≈ 1.04 for density (spin-0 × spin-0) and ≈ 1.26 for shear (spin-2 × spin-0, map-based). The >1 ratio is expected: mode coupling from partial sky mixes power between bins, increasing variance beyond what Knox predicts.\n\n**For catalog-based shear** (production default): the NaMaster Gaussian covariance is computed using an auxiliary map-based NmtField. The catalog field measures the spectrum (via NmtFieldCatalog), but the covariance workspace requires map-domain masks that NmtFieldCatalog can't expose. Since covariance depends on mask geometry and auto-spectra (not the measurement method), the map-based covariance is valid for catalog spectra. This gives uniform NaMaster error bars across all probes.\n\n**Bug history**: An interleaved diagonal extraction bug inflated the apparent NaMaster/Knox ratio to ~31× for spin-2 fields. The NaMaster `gaussian_covariance()` output for spin-2 × spin-0 is (2·nbins, 2·nbins) with Eκ and Bκ components interleaved as (bin0_Eκ, bin0_Bκ, bin1_Eκ, ...). Plain `np.diag(cov)[:nbins]` mixed components from wrong bins. Fixed via `extract_covariance_diagonal()` in `nmt_utils.py`.\n\n**Script**: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_covariance_validation.py`",
      "outcome": "NaMaster Gaussian covariance validated against Knox formula. Density (spin-0): median NaMaster/Knox = 1.04 (range 0.96–2.21, std 0.15). Shear (spin-2, map-based auxiliary field): ~1.26. Role split: NaMaster for plot error bars (captures mode coupling), Knox for S/N annotations and likelihood chi2/PTE/A_lens (avoids coupling matrix artifact at ℓ~2700). Catalog-based shear uses map-based auxiliary NmtField for covariance since NmtFieldCatalog cannot expose masks. Interleaved diagonal extraction bug (31× overestimate) fixed in nmt_utils.extract_covariance_diagonal().",

Two shear measurement pipelines (lensmc, metacal), galaxy density from the GC catalog, and 11 VMPZ-ID systematic maps. The footprint covers ~385 deg² across two spatial patches. Masking follows spectra.make_mask: weights multiplied into the binary footprint, then C2 apodized.\n\n## Shear maps\n\n- **Pipelines**: lensmc, metacal — independent shape measurement methods\n- **Per-bin products**: e₁/e₂ shear maps, sum_weights, n_eff\n- **All-bin**: union across `config[tomography.bin_ids]`\n- **Sign convention**: Euclid e₁ along RA; HEALPix Q along colatitude → [-e₁, e₂] for NaMaster (pol_conv=COSMO)\n- **Noise**: NOISE_CL in FITS headers = σ²_comp / n_eff_sr (flat shape noise per component)\n\n## Galaxy density maps\n\n- **Source catalog**: `config[gc_catalog]` (parquet)\n- **Bins**: `config[gc_tom_bins]`\n- **Products**: δ overdensity + selection mask per bin\n- **Density mask is strictly binary**: `build_density_maps.py` sets mask = 1 for every occupied pixel, 0 elsewhere. Only one distinct non-zero value (confirmed bin=3). `make_convergence_mask` then applies `apodize(mask > 0) * mask`, which is apodize(binary) * 1 — the weight factor contributes nothing extra (contrast with shear where `weights=[weight_map]` tapers by varying galaxy weights).\n- **Shot noise**: N_ℓ = 1/n̄_sr (constant per mode)\n\n## CMB lensing mask apodization\n\n`make_cmb_mask` calls `nmt.mask_apodization(mask, aposcale, \"C2\")` on the input. The ACT DR6 baseline mask is already the official 3° cos² apodized lensing mask (Qu+ 2023 Sec 5.3). Applying a second 0.15° C2 pass changes mask pixel values by at most 6.3×10⁻⁴ (rms 2.6×10⁻⁵), zero change in fsky — negligible. This is benign: the long-scale ACT apodization dwarfs the 0.15° second pass.\n\n## Systematic maps\n\n11 VMPZ-ID maps at nside 16384 (NESTED), downgraded to analysis nside at load time:\nstellar_density, galactic_extinction, exposures, zodiacal_light, saa, psf, noise, persistence, star_brightness_mean, galaxy_number_density, phz_quality\n\n## Tomographic binning\n\n`config[tomography.n_bins]` bins (IDs: `config[tomography.bin_ids]`). Shear n(z) from `config[nz.wl]`; density n(z) from `config[nz.gc]`.\n\n## Weight masking\n\nspectra.make_mask(): binary footprint × weights, then apodize. Scale: `config[cross_correlation.aposcale]`°. For density, weights=[binary mask], so C2 apodization acts on a hard edge — visible rolloff at the footprint boundary. For shear, weights=[sum_weights], so the taper is smoothed by varying galaxy counts before apodization.\n\n## Estimator\n\n`config[cross_correlation.estimator]`: catalog (NmtFieldCatalog, bypasses map-making) or map (NmtField).\n\n## Apodization audit\n\nVisualized in `cmbx/files/results_claims_euclid_density_apodization_euclid_density_apodization.png` (rule `plot_euclid_density_apodization`).

      "body": "Cross-correlating CMB lensing convergence with the shapes and positions of photometric galaxies probes the growth of large-scale structure across cosmic time, testing ΛCDM with independent observables from two entirely different physical effects. This analysis measures C_ℓ^{γκ} and C_ℓ^{δκ} between Euclid RR2 weak lensing shear / galaxy density and CMB lensing convergence from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G (winter), across 6 tomographic bins.\n\n**Headline result**: Both cross-correlations are detected at high significance with ACT DR6 after resolving the Euclid position-angle sign convention (`pol_conv=\"EUCLID\"` → [-e1, +e2] for NaMaster; see `shear-sign-convention-test-b751c2ca`). Galaxy density × CMB-κ: A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (ACT, χ²/dof = 1.07), 0.857 ± 0.050 (SPT). Shear × CMB-κ: A_lens = 0.880 ± 0.052 (lensmc × ACT, 17σ), 0.850 ± 0.055 (metacal × ACT, 15σ), 0.694 ± 0.045 (lensmc × SPT), 0.697 ± 0.048 (metacal × SPT). After marginalizing over 11 systematic contamination templates: density A_lens = 0.986 ± 0.122 (ACT), 0.812 ± 0.122 (SPT); shear A_lens = 0.824 ± 0.095 (lensmc × ACT), 0.780 ± 0.097 (metacal × ACT). SPT shows a persistent 15–20% amplitude deficit across all tracers — a CMB-side normalization issue under investigation (`spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41`).\n\n**Motivation**: CMB lensing × cosmic shear is insensitive to additive shear systematics (which don't correlate with the CMB) and CMB lensing multiplicative biases — making it a robust, nearly model-independent probe of the projected matter distribution at z ~ 0.3–1.5. Euclid's wide southern survey provides the galaxy data; ACT and SPT provide CMB lensing over overlapping patches of 261 deg² and 115 deg² respectively.\n\n**Comparator analyses**: \n- DES × ACT DR6: Qu+ 2023 (`docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT methods: Chang+ 2022 (`docs/papers/2203.12439_des_spt_planck_methods/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT correlations: Omori+ 2022 (`docs/papers/2203.12440_des_spt_planck_correlations/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT 2026 update: `cmbx/files/docs_papers_des_spt_shearxlensing_2026_shearXlensing_20260202.pdf`.\n- ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum: Madhavacheril+ 2024 (`cmbx/files/docs_arxiv_2304.05202_act_dr6_lensing_power_main.tex`).\n- SPT-3G winter lensing: `cmbx/files/docs_papers_spt_winter_lensing_apssamp.tex`.\n\n**Collaboration**: SPT-Euclid MoU (DR1-KP-CMBX-3/2) — see [MOU proposal](.felt/spt-euclid-mou-collaboration-6de6bc54.md).

      "body": "Angular cross-power spectra are estimated via the NaMaster pseudo-Cℓ formalism (Alonso+ 2019), which corrects for mode-coupling induced by partial-sky masks through a coupling matrix and decouples into bandpowers. This section describes the estimators, masking, and covariance used throughout the analysis.\n\n## Pseudo-Cℓ estimation\n\nWe measure cross-power spectra C^{fκ}_ℓ between Euclid tracers (shear γ or galaxy density δ) and CMB lensing convergence κ. All spectra are computed at nside=2048, lmax=3000, using 20 linearly-spaced bandpowers.\n\n### Map-based estimator (production)\n\nThe production estimator operates on HEALPix maps. Shear maps enter NaMaster as spin-2 fields (`NmtField` with `pol_conv=\"IAU\"`, lmax=3000); density overdensity maps and CMB κ maps enter as spin-0 fields. The mode-coupling matrix is computed from the apodized mask geometry and cached via `joblib` hash of the mask alms — the expensive coupling matrix computation happens once per mask pair and is reused across tomographic bins and shear methods.\n\nFor shear: `make_field([e1_map, e2_map], mask, spin=2, pol_conv=\"IAU\")`. For density: `make_field([delta_map], mask, spin=0)`. For CMB κ: `make_field([kappa_map], cmb_mask, spin=0)`.\n\nRules: `compute_cross_spectrum` (spectra.smk). Library: `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data.spectra` — `make_field()`, `get_spectrum()`, `get_workspace()`.\n\n### Catalog-based estimator (validation)\n\nThe catalog estimator bypasses map-making entirely: `NmtFieldCatalog` takes individual galaxy positions and ellipticities as a point cloud and computes spherical harmonic transforms in position space. This eliminates pixelization artifacts. Agreement with the map estimator — median bandpower correlation r=0.998, A_lens consistent within 1σ for every bin — confirms that map construction introduces no measurable bias.\n\nCovariance for the catalog path uses an auxiliary map-based `NmtField` from the same shear maps, since `NmtFieldCatalog.get_mask()` raises ValueError. The covariance depends on mask geometry and auto-spectra, not the measurement method, so this is valid.\n\nRule: `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum` (explorations.smk). ~8 GB, 3-4 min/job at lmax=3000.\n\n## Masking and apodization\n\nPartial-sky pseudo-Cℓ estimation requires apodized masks to suppress spectral ringing from sharp survey boundaries. Four input masks — Euclid shear (continuous weights × binary footprint), Euclid density (binary), ACT DR6 (pre-apodized with 3° cosine-squared rolloff), and SPT-3G (border-apodized) — are C2-apodized at 0.15 rad (~8.6°), producing 10 mask products: 4 individual + 6 pairwise cross-products.\n\nShear masks: `footprint × weight_map → C2(0.15)`. The continuous weight map creates a smooth taper. Density masks: binary footprint → C2(0.15), producing only a ~9 arcmin edge taper. CMB masks: pre-apodized by experiment + additional 0.15° C2 pass (negligible for ACT, shapes SPT border).\n\nEffective sky fractions (Hivon fsky_eff): shear×ACT 0.70%, shear×SPT 0.32%, density×ACT 0.67%, density×SPT 0.30%.\n\nRules: `build_rr2_apodized_masks`, `build_apodized_pair_masks` (maps.smk). Library: `make_mask()`, `make_cmb_mask()`.\n\n## Covariance estimation\n\nTwo independent estimates validate each other:\n\n**Knox formula** (primary for all χ²/PTE/S/N): `Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes_b` where `n_modes = Σ(2ℓ+1) · fsky_eff` with `fsky_eff = <w1·w2>² / <w1²·w2²>` (Hivon+ 2002 Eq. 17). Analytic, immune to coupling matrix numerics.\n\n**NaMaster Gaussian** (error bars in plots): Uses the Improved Narrow Kernel Approximation (INKA) with theory+noise guess spectra. For spin-2 × spin-0, output is `(2·nbins, 2·nbins)` with interleaved E/B components — extracted via `extract_covariance_block` to the `(nbins, nbins)` E-mode block. Known artifact: last bandpower (ℓ≈2700) has near-zero variance from coupling matrix numerics (~1000× below Knox). This is why Knox is used for quantitative inference.\n\nNaMaster/Knox ratio: 1.04 median for density (spin-0), ~1.26 for shear (spin-2). The >1 ratio reflects mode coupling from partial sky mixing power between bins — expected behavior.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCore library: `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data.spectra` (`cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1data_spectra.py`). Key functions: `make_mask()`, `make_field()`, `make_catalog_field()`, `get_spectrum()`, `map2cls()`, `get_workspace()`, `compute_knox_variance()`, `extract_covariance_block()`.\n\nSnakemake rules: `compute_cross_spectrum` (production), `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum` (validation), `build_rr2_apodized_masks`, `build_apodized_pair_masks`, `compute_systematic_cross_spectrum`.",

Density × κ: A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (χ²/dof = 1.07, PTE = 0.28); all null tests consistent with zero; template marginalization yields A_lens = 0.986 ± 0.122.

This layer takes four input masks — Euclid shear (continuous weights × binary footprint), Euclid density (binary), ACT DR6 (pre-apodized with 3° cosine-squared rolloff), and SPT-3G (border-apodized) — and produces the 10 C2-apodized products needed by the estimators: 4 individual masks plus all 6 pairwise cross-products (shear×ACT, shear×SPT, density×ACT, density×SPT, ACT×SPT, shear×density). The apodization kernel is C2 at 0.15 rad (~8.6°), following gctools conventions. Effective sky fractions are small: shear×ACT 0.70%, shear×SPT 0.32%, density×ACT 0.67%, density×SPT 0.30% — driven by the intersection of Euclid's ~385 deg² RR2 footprint with the CMB lensing patches.\n\nTwo Snakemake rules implement this: `build_rr2_apodized_masks` (the 10 shared masks) and `build_apodized_pair_masks` (per-bin per-CMB pair masks for the estimators). Downstream: [Map Harmonic Estimator](.felt/map-based-harmonic-space-5f227b0f.md) consumes these masks via `make_mask()` and `make_cmb_mask()` in `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data.spectra`.",

Effective fsky: shear×ACT 0.70%, shear×SPT 0.32%, density×ACT 0.67%, density×SPT 0.30%. Shear support_fraction (0.93%) exceeds effective_fraction anomalously — weight variability inflates the support relative to Hivon effective area; density (binary weights) shows the expected support > effective ordering. Per-bin per-CMB pair masks built by build_apodized_pair_masks. Memory tuned: density_map at 4–24 GB (bin-dependent), rr2_apodized at 24 GB.

      "body": "A single-glance diagnostic showing which systematic × tracer × tomographic bin combinations pass the null test. The heatmap displays PTE (probability to exceed) from the χ² test of C^{fS}_ℓ = 0 for each cell. Red cells (PTE < 0.05) indicate the measured cross-spectrum is unlikely to be noise; blue cells (PTE > 0.95) would indicate anomalously low scatter. This complements the contamination overview (X^f_S) by testing whether the *tracer* side of the contamination chain is consistent with zero, independently of the CMB κ side.\n\n## Layout\n\n11 rows (sysmaps) × 18 columns (3 tracers × 6 tomographic bins). Colormap: `vlag` (diverging, red–blue) with saturated tails — PTE < 0.05 maps to the same extreme red (all failures identical), PTE > 0.95 to extreme blue, interior [0.05, 0.95] spans the full color range. Cells annotated by PTE value (2 decimal places). Missing data in light gray.\n\n## Results\n\n- **Density**: 0/66 pass (all PTE = 0.00). Expected — galaxy positions physically correlate with survey depth, stellar density, etc. This is not a failure of the analysis; it confirms the maps contain real structure.\n- **LensMC**: 56/66 pass (85%). Failures in galactic extinction, galaxy number density, and persistence at specific bins (2, 5, 6).\n- **Metacal**: 57/66 pass (86%). Similar failure pattern to lensmc.\n\n## Caveat\n\nError bars use NaMaster Gaussian covariance, which is not yet validated for tracer × sysmap cross-spectra. The PTE pass/fail rates may reflect error bar mis-estimation rather than true contamination. This heatmap should be read as a preliminary diagnostic, not a definitive verdict. See `namaster-gaussian-covariance-9373b1fa` for covariance validation status.\n\n## Implementation\n\nRule: `plot_pte_heatmap` (explorations.smk, localrule).

      "body": "## Shear × κ is not detected\n\n### Finding\n\nThe shear × CMB lensing cross-correlation is **not detected** in any tomographic bin, for either CMB experiment, for both shear methods, and for both map and catalog estimators. This is the most important open issue in the pipeline.\n\n**A_lens per bin (lensmc × ACT, Knox variance):**\n\n| Bin | A_lens (map) | A_lens (metacal map) |\n|-----|-------------|---------------------|\n| 1   | 0.03 ± 0.27 | 0.10 ± 0.26        |\n| 2   | 0.10 ± 0.21 | -0.09 ± 0.23       |\n| 3   | 0.18 ± 0.17 | 0.18 ± 0.19        |\n| 4   | 0.17 ± 0.13 | 0.09 ± 0.14        |\n| 5   | 0.02 ± 0.09 | 0.16 ± 0.10        |\n| 6   | 0.04 ± 0.07 | 0.10 ± 0.07        |\n\n**Joint A_lens (all consistent with zero):**\n\n| | ACT | SPT |\n|---|---|---|\n| Lensmc | 0.062 ± 0.045 (S/N = −0.8) | −0.053 ± 0.040 (S/N = 0.5) |\n| Metacal | 0.108 ± 0.048 (S/N = −0.1) | −0.009 ± 0.044 (S/N = 0.6) |\n\nAll four combinations 18–24σ from unity. ACT and SPT agree: no shear signal.\n\n**Meanwhile, density × κ is strongly detected:** A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (ACT), 0.857 ± 0.050 (SPT).\n\n### Systematic investigation (iteration 2026-02-25)\n\n#### Ruled out\n\n1. **Map-making bug** — Catalog estimator (NmtFieldCatalog, bypasses pixelization) gives the same A ≈ 0.1.\n2. **Method-specific issue** — Both lensmc AND metacal give A ≈ 0.1. Methods are independent (forward-model vs metacal).\n3. **NaMaster spin-2 bug** — Density (spin-0 × spin-0) works, and the binned coupling matrix roundtrip is perfect (amplification = 1.0 ± 2e-14).\n4. **pol_conv issue** — IAU convention passes e1, e2 unflipped to NaMaster. A sign error would produce a negative B-mode, not suppress E-mode to zero. B-modes scatter around zero as expected.\n5. **Theory prediction wrong** — Independent CCL computation (with bbks transfer) matches stored eDR1like.Theory within 2-6%. Theory at ℓ=100 for bin3: 8.8e-9 (stored) vs 9.0e-9 (direct).\n6. **Bandpower window normalization** — E→E window sums per bin: 1.00 ± 0.01 (first bin 1.075, all others within 0.1%).\n7. **Catalog blinding** — Marseille JC1 summary (Oct 2025): \"cross-correlations (including the mixes we rely on) stay unblinded.\"\n8. **Multiplicative bias** — LensMC talk reports |m| ~ 2×10⁻³ from simulations. (1+m)² ≈ 1 — can't explain 90% suppression.\n9. **Galaxy resolution** — `she_metacal_r2/(r2+psf_r2)` = 0.74 (well-resolved). S/N median = 92. These are high-quality shape measurements.\n10. **Low statistical power** — Per-bandpower theory/σ ≈ 1.3 (theory comparable to Knox error). Expected A_lens S/N ~ 6 per bin with 20 bandpowers. The signal should be detectable.\n11. **Observational systematics** — Shear × systematic null tests pass 114/154 (74%) with median χ²/dof = 1.29. The 26% failure rate is elevated above 5% but the chi2 values are moderate (1.6–2.2 for worst per-bin offenders: galactic extinction, star brightness, noise, galaxy density, photo-z quality). This level of systematic contamination cannot explain a 90% signal suppression. By contrast, density × systematic fails 77/77 (expected — galaxy positions correlate with observational depth by construction), yet density × κ gives A_lens = 1.05.\n\n#### Still possible\n\n1. **Missing metacal response correction** — In standard metacal, `e_corrected` is the PSF-corrected ellipticity but NOT divided by the shear response <R>. The response correction is applied at the ensemble level: γ = <e>/<R>. If <R> ~ 0.7 (typical for well-resolved galaxies), this would give A_lens ≈ 0.1/0.7 ≈ 0.15 — still far from 1.0. So this alone doesn't explain the non-detection.\n\n2. **Response correction needed AND response is lower than expected** — If the Euclid metacal response <R> differs from DES/HSC values due to pipeline differences, it could be smaller. But R ~ 0.1 (needed to explain the data) would mean the shapes are nearly unresponsive to shear, inconsistent with the good resolution.\n\n3. **PSF correction consuming the lensing signal** — The SHE validation talks mention persistent PSF size biases. If the PSF model systematically absorbs galaxy shear, the corrected ellipticities would lack lensing correlation. This would be a deep upstream bug.\n\n4. **Unexplained catalog issue** — SHE validation notes \"first unblinded cosmological constraints\" from RR2, suggesting signal exists for other groups measuring shear 2-point statistics (γγ). If they see signal in γγ but we don't in γ×κ, the issue is subtle.\n\n### Evidence chain\n\n```\ndensity × κ detected (A=1) → CMB κ maps correct + NaMaster works + galaxy positions/n(z) correct\ntheory verified independently → CCL prediction is right\nlensmc == metacal (both ~0.1) → NOT a method-specific bug\nmap == catalog → NOT a map-making bug\nblinding ruled out → cross-correlations unblinded per JC1\ncalibration m ~ 0.002 → can't explain 90% suppression\nshear × systematic mostly passes (74%) → tested systematics don't explain non-detection\ndensity × systematic all fail but density × κ detected → systematic correlations ≠ signal contamination\n```\n\n### Next steps\n\n1. **Ask Margherita/Giulio**: Does `e_corrected` need a response correction beyond the m-matrix? What is <R> for this catalog? Has anyone measured γγ auto-spectrum from RR2 and gotten cosmological signal?\n2. **Check sp_validation results**: The CosmoStat validation team should have measured γγ from RR2. Do their results show signal?\n3. **Estimate <R> from the catalog**: If metacal response can be computed from `she_metacal_r2` and galaxy properties, derive <R> empirically.",
      "outcome": "Resolved: the shear non-detection was caused by incorrect ellipticity sign convention in the NaMaster field construction. Euclid catalogs define position angle from West toward North (not standard IAU North toward East). The correct mapping is pol_conv='EUCLID' → [-e1, +e2] in make_field. With the fix: lensmc×ACT A_lens = 0.880 ± 0.052 (17σ), metacal×ACT = 0.850 ± 0.055 (15σ). Both shear methods detected at high significance with chi2/dof ≈ 0.9-1.0. SPT shear amplitudes are 0.69-0.70, consistent with the known SPT normalization deficit (~15-20% low across all tracers). See shear-sign-convention-test-b751c2ca for the full investigation.",

Benjamin to captain a dedicated tiger team.\n\n## What was tried\n\n### Nicholas de Sore — Cl cuts\n- Split by faint/bright, large/small objects\n- \"Interesting things but nothing conclusive\"\n\n### 2D mass maps\n- Benjamin: \"might be a hint of structure\" but no smoking gun\n\n### Angus — 2PCF vs CosmoPipe comparison\n- Significant B-modes regardless of method (L3 2PCF or KiDS CosmoPipe)\n- **Discrepancy between L3 and CosmoPipe on some scales** — being investigated\n- Angus provided KiDS data to cross-check; expected to be a fixable issue\n- Masking tests: effective coverage mask (>0.8) removes ~couple orders of B-mode but still significant at ~1e-9. Cluster-based mask also doesn't eliminate.\n\n### Chris Duncan — PSF size residuals\n- Useful diagnostic but not clearly the source\n- PSF looks good on small scales — confusing why B-modes appear on large scales\n- PSF has been improved since R2 but large-scale B-modes haven't changed much\n\n### Sasha — rho/tau statistics\n- Various patches, faint/bright cuts\n- UCL team selected patches avoiding edge/overlap complications\n- **PSF appears to be behaving fairly well** — no obvious PSF-galaxy correlation\n\n### Lila — C-bias residual patterns on sky\n- Initially noticed funny patterns\n- Resolved as projection issue (detector → sky coordinates) with Gordon and Chris\n- Redmine issue open for documentation\n\n### Leonor (UCL) — Average ellipticity in clean patches\n- Some odd behavior in a few patches\n- Not clearly connected to B-modes\n\n### Angus — SOM correlations\n- Self-organizing maps looking for ellipticity correlations with survey parameters\n- Nothing clear; more detailed analysis planned\n\n## Key discussion points\n- **Simulations**: \"If only we had simulations\" — DPS downtime adds ~1 month delay. Nico clarified: never planned to do 100 sq deg sims, only 32 small patches across DR1. Full survey sims could be prioritized but pipeline is late.\n- **PSF propagation**: Would be useful to propagate PSF size biases to see if they produce large-scale B-modes, but no simulation infrastructure for this.\n- **Alan**: Offered to run data through ALMANAC (Bayesian B-mode power spectrum sampler) — to coordinate with Benjamin/Sam/Angus.\n- **Masking + C-bias recomputation**: Angus plans to recompute C-term after masking selections (now has Jacobians from CosmoHub catalog). Doubts it will change C-term significantly, but wants to test C-term vs brightness etc.\n\n## Assessment\nSource unknown. Could be PSF-related, could be something else entirely. \"They can hide very well and we have to dig deeper\" (Henry). Cannot categorically rule out going \"all the way back\" to fundamentals.",

Cross-correlating these suppresses cosmic shear signal, isolating C-bias residuals.\n\n- Works in detector-plane coordinates (not HEALPix — flat 100x100 pixel grid per FoV)\n- Applies rotation from sky → detector plane, corrects for telescope distortion\n- Produces E-mode, B-mode, and EB cross-spectra per FoV\n- Multipole range: ~600 (FoV scale) to ~20,000 (0.01 deg within FoV)\n\n## Key results (RR2 data)\n\n### Raw vs C-corrected\n- Raw tiles show large C-bias power, especially at FoV scales\n- Gordon's C-bias correction significantly reduces power — but **residual power remains**\n- Residual power concentrated at ~1-2 points across FoV (larger scales)\n- LensMC residuals smaller than MetaCal (MetaCal noisier)\n\n### Statistical significance\n- 3-4 sigma detection of residual E and B mode power after C-correction\n- Null test (random rotation of ellipticities) → large p-values, consistent with no signal\n- EB cross-spectrum consistent with zero\n\n### Method refinement (ongoing)\n- **Changed from stacked to single-tile**: Originally stacked ~20 tiles + iterated one at a time. Now uses single tile vs complementary stack — avoids inter-tile correlations, tiles are independent.\n- **Bootstrap covariance**: Replaced sub-covariance (scatter across realizations) with bootstrap resampling of fields — measures coherent detector-plane C-bias pattern (survey-average).\n- Code speed-ups underway; computationally feasible for TR1/DR1.\n\n## Discussion\n- **Wada**: Masking applied per-object (inheriting HEALPix mask values) — didn't change tomography or lens weights.\n- **Alex**: C-bias recomputation after masking not yet done (Angus planned).\n- **Benjamin**: Advantage over real-space (Heymans & Schneider)? → Complementary, not fundamentally different. Costas has pseudo-Cl experience.\n- **Vini**: Can you rotate Cls back to sky coordinates to forward-propagate the systematic? → In principle yes, but limited by FoV scales. Low multipoles unreliable due to large mask.\n- **Interpretation**: Primarily a null test / diagnostic tool. Detects residual power but doesn't identify source (could be PSF, electronics, etc.).\n\n## Next steps\n- Apply to TR1, then DR1 (standard project for DR1)\n- Add tomographic analysis if tile count sufficient\n- Link to slides to be shared on WL-SWG common deck",

Lets us compare results without unblinding and simplifies collaboration across working groups.\n\nDone with support from Sam Farrens but outside the official Euclid 3x2pt blinding framework. We match the JC1 scheme as closely as possible: a list of cosmologies generates corresponding data-vector shifts, and one shift is randomly picked by an external blinder (Sam Farrens or Chaitanya Chawak).\n\n## Consistency Requirements\n\nTo stay consistent with 3x2pt, we need:\n\n1. The same cosmology list used in JC1 to produce our shifts\n2. Verification that our shifts match CLOE's for the common data vectors:\n   - Galaxy clustering (dd)\n   - Weak lensing (gg)\n   - Galaxy-galaxy lensing (dg)\n\nThis verification is our responsibility.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Produce unblinded data vectors from catalogs on the SAS\n2. Run basic numerical checks for pathologies — never plot them\n3. Submit via Redmine to Sam Farrens and Chaitanya Chawak:\n   - Unblinded data vectors\n   - Our computed shifts\n   - Mixing matrices\n4. Receive blinded vectors back\n\nThe mixing matrix must be applied after blinding. Alternatively, we could pass pre-mixed blinded vectors instead of the unblinded vector, shifts, and matrix separately.\n\n## The Blinding Transformation\n\nFollowing the JC1 scheme, blinding applies a shift at the level of summary statistics:\n\nC_l^blind = C_l^obs + DC_l\n\nwhere DC_l = C_l(theta_ref + Dtheta) - C_l(theta_ref)\n\n- theta_ref: reference (fiducial) cosmology\n- Dtheta: blind parameter shift, drawn from a predefined list\n- The reference cosmology should describe the data well\n- The blinded result remains consistent with a realization of theta_ref + Dtheta\n\nOne shift is selected at random by the external blinder from the predefined list.\n\n## Data Format Specification\n\nFollowing the DPDD 2PCF format for Euclid's 3x2pt data products, extended for CMBX cross-correlations.\n\n### Data Vector Components\n\n| Component | DPDD Product | Spectra (6 bins) |\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|\n| dd | TwoPCFWLClPosPos2D | 21 (6 auto + 15 cross) |\n| gg | TwoPCFWLPEBShearShear2D | 21 (6 auto + 15 cross) |\n| dg | TwoPCFWLPEBPosShear2D | 36 (6x6) |\n| dk | (extension) | 6 |\n| gk | (extension) | 6 |\n| kk | (extension) | 1 |\n| **Total** | | **91 spectra** |\n\nWith ~20 l-bins per spectrum: ~1820 data points.\n\n### FITS Structure\n\nEach data product follows the DPDD 2PCF structure:\n- Primary HDU: Metadata keywords including BLINDING flag, SOFTNAME, SOFTVERS, angular binning parameters\n- Extension HDUs: One per bin combination, named {TYPE}_{n}\n- HDU headers: BIN_ID1, BIN_ID2 specify the tomographic bin pair\n\nStandard columns: ELL, ELL_LOWER, ELL_UPPER\n\n### CMBX Extensions\n\nFor CMB lensing cross-correlations (dk, gk, kk):\n- HDU naming: POSKAPPA_CL_{n}, SHEARKAPPA_PEB_{n}, KAPPAKAPPA_CL_1\n- CMB lensing has no tomography: use BIN_ID2=0 for k\n- Follow same column structure as corresponding Euclid products\n\n### Shift Vectors\n\nMatch the data vector structure exactly. Multiple shift files: shifts_001.fits, shifts_002.fits, etc.\n\n## Implementation Status\n\nA prototype shift-generation script exists. It computes DC_l = -C_l^bandpower(theta_ref) + C_l^bandpower(theta_shift) and saves to timestamped pickle files. Output format will be converted to DPDD-aligned FITS.\n\n## Open Items\n\n- Obtain cosmology parameter list from JC1 (Martin Crocce / Guadalupe)\n- Establish Redmine issue template for shift submission\n- Confirm timeline with Sam Farrens\n- Validate theory code agreement with CLOE on common vectors\n\n## References\n\n- Muir et al. 2019 (arXiv:1911.05929): Blinding multi-probe cosmological experiments\n- Euclid DPDD: http://st-dm.pages.euclid-sgs.uk/data-product-doc/dmdr1/\n- JC1 blinding slides",

We have taken inspiration from the tests performed in the [DES x SPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12440) and Q1 cross-correlation analyses.\n\n## Q1 tests\n\n1. Building jackknives maps from random split of the RR2 sample (null galaxy clustering signal maps) and use them as signal to compute their auto-correlation and CMB lensing cross-correlation.\n2. Cross-correlation between RR2 sample and CMB lensing maps for which we expect to have no or detectable cosmological signal (ACT curl mode map or ACT diff 150GHz - 90 GHz)\n3. Cross-correlation of RR2 sample with CMB lensing maps derived with different type of lensing reconstruction estimators that have different sensitivity to Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds.\n\n[Slides from Giulio on Q1 validation tests](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sxCQnp2zRyyd5Zz-Si0FJz7kpVjmUlOjq1iaQYkstO0/edit?slide=id.g36c87a7ff49_0_50#slide=id.g36c87a7ff49_0_50)\n\n## DES x SPT tests\n\n1. **Survey property (i.e. systematic) map cross-correlations.**\n   If we are worried about a given systematic affecting both tracers and thus contributing to the cross-correlation, can make a map that probes this systematic and cross correlate it with each tracer, and potentially deproject a systematics template if the contamination is significant. In the DES x SPT analysis, they do make survey property maps of stellar density, extinction, PSF ellipticity errors, and PSF size errors.\n\n2. **Cross-shear gamma_x.**\n   In the DES x SPT analysis the shear catalog is cross-correlated directly with the CMB lensing map without producing an intermediate shear map. This is done by taking the tangential component of each galaxy's ellipticity relative to each kappa_CMB pixel to form <gamma_t kappa_CMB>. If instead the component of the galaxy shear oriented 45º relative to each kappa_CMB pixel is taken one can form <gamma_x kappa_CMB> which should be consistent with zero. At least until lensing curl from post-Born effects is detectable.\n\n3. **Effect of delta_g weights on <delta_g kappa_CMB>.**\n   Application of galaxy position weights is intended to reduce systematics, so this isn't exactly a null test. But performing the cross-correlation with and without the weights can give a sense of how big the weight correction is, and can be propagated to cosmological parameters.\n\n4. **Point-source masking in kappa_CMB.**\n   To make sure the inpainting of point sources in the CMB temperature maps is not biasing the lensing reconstruction, they try simply masking these point sources instead. Not clear if they mask the original CMB maps, or just the lensing construction.\n\n5. **Spatial variations in kappa_CMB.**\n   They split their kappa_CMB maps into northern and southern patches, and then cross-correlate both with an external tracer (e.g. CIB). The two cross-correlations should be consistent. This is mostly a test of the lensing maps, but if you saw inconsistency between spatial splits of <gamma_t kappa_CMB> or <delta_g kappa_CMB>, this would help tease out whether the problem is on the CMB or galaxy side.\n\n## Other\n\n1. Sample selection cuts (magnitude, shear weights, etc.). Will require recalibration of shear?\n2. Consistency between tracers:\n   - kappa_CMB: ACT vs. SPT vs. Planck, MV vs Pol reconstruction, bias hardening...\n   - gamma: Metacal vs. Lensmc\n   - delta_g: only one tracer?\n3. Null shear & galaxy maps\n\n## RR2 validation tests proposal [16 July 2025]\n\nLinked to task #31817\n\nFollowing Q1 analysis, we can perform catalog based, spatial based, and CMB lensing null tests and validation. The tests we can do for RR2 depends on the availability of external data (for CMB lensing side), Euclid data and correlated simulations. We do not plan to have correlated simulations with foreground contaminations for RR2 but that is something we should aim for DR1 (eg Agora sims).\n\n1. Cross correlation with jackknives maps from random split of the RR2 sample, nulling galaxy clustering signal\n2. Cross correlation with CMB lensing maps with no signal (curl map, frequency difference maps)\n   - TODO: list available lensing maps for Planck, ACT and SPT\n3. Cross correlation with CMB lensing maps obtained with different estimators (tSZ cleaned leg in the quadratic estimator, different masking, T only versus Pol only versus MV)\n   - TODO: list available lensing maps for Planck, ACT and SPT\n4. Check consistency of cross-correlations with Planck vs ACT vs SPT\n5. Survey property (i.e. systematic) map cross-correlations, following DESxSPT analysis, needs:\n   - TODO: get extinction and stellar density maps (from Gaia data, or Euclid internal)\n   - TODO: PSF error map\n6. Cross-shear gamma_x\n   - TODO: this test is designed in real space, check if correspondence in multipole space is to use mode B lensing maps\n7. Spatial variation: In RR2 we have two patches in the south only. We can further divide the large one into two smaller patches",

These include cross-correlations of Euclid Q1 EDF-S galaxy density with Planck/ACT (led by Giulio Fabbian) and SPT-3G (led by Cail Daley), and DES shear cross-correlation with SPT-3G (led by Aaron Ouellette). Lessons learned from these analyses as well as preparatory work on likelihoods and parameter inference will allow us to make quick progress on this once the data is shared.\n\n**Datasets**:\n\n* Euclid:\n  1. DR1 position and shear catalogs, maps, and official 3x2pt data products\n  2. RR2 position and shear catalogs (only to validate pipeline before DR1 arrives)\n  3. Flagship simulation products\n* SPT:\n  1. SPT-3G lensing maps for Main, Summer A/B, and EDF-S fields\n     (MV, Pol-only, T-only, bias-hardened, etc.)\n  2.

Likelihoods and cosmological parameter constraints including CMB lensing autospectra will also be delivered.\n\n**Overview**:\nCMB lensing (κ) cross-correlated with galaxy positions (δ) and shear (γ) is a powerful cosmological probe that can also be used to calibrate shear and galaxy clustering measurements. For example the DES-SPT-Planck 6x2pt analysis (Abbott et al. 2023\\) using all 6 combinations of δ, γ, and κ tightened constraints on Ωm by 30% and S8 by 50% compared to the DES δ and γ-only 3x2pt, placed 5-10% independent constraints on the shear multiplicative bias, and shed light on potential systematics in DES galaxy samples. Similar analyses performed with Euclid will be critical for maximizing the cosmological return from the data, both in terms of directly tightening parameter constraints and identifying/mitigating potential systematics in Euclid data. DR1 κγ cross-correlations with SPT and Planck are expected to improve the (Ωm, σ8) figure of merit (FoM) by \\~25% compared to γγ-only constraints (M. Gatti forecast).\n\nSPT provides the deepest CMB lensing maps per-pixel currently available, and SPT's Main and Summer fields have excellent overlap with Euclid RR2 and DR1 (see Figure 1 on following page). The overlapping sky fractions for SPT-3G Main and Summer are 1.56% (\\~650 deg²) and 2.53% (\\~1000 deg²) respectively, giving a total overlapping area of 3.91% (1600 deg²) compared to 4.32% (1800 deg²) for all of DR1. SPT-3G x DR1 South κγ measurements are expected to improve the (Ωm, σ8) FoM by 14% compared to Euclid γγ; the corresponding improvement from Planck x DR1 North is expected to be 8% (M. Gatti forecast; Figure 2 on following page). For κδ, extrapolating the preliminary single-tomographic-bin SPT-3G x EDF-S κδ SNR of \\~9 to the DR1 footprint gives SNRs of \\~43 for each of the SPT-3G Main and Summer fields, and a combined SNR of \\~60.\n\nWe propose a cross-correlation analysis between SPT-3G Main and Summer κ with Euclid DR1 δ and γ, specifically targeting the CMB lensing block of the 6𝗑2𝗉𝗍 data vector (δκ, γκ, and κκ). We will hereafter refer to this combination as 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍, in contrast to the standard position-shear 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍 of δδ, γγ, and δγ. Constraints from 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍 and 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍 were found to be approximately equally constraining in Abbott et al. (2023), so the cosmological results from this combination alone are expected to be powerful. The data vectors and likelihoods produced within this project will be used to constraint ΛCDM model parameters and extensions. While both the SPT-3G Main and Summer lensing spectra have been unblinded, the Summer analysis is less mature compared to Winter; if the Summer maps are not sufficiently robust in time we can descope to a Winter-only cross-correlation. If time allows, the project scope can be expanded into a full 6𝗑2𝗉𝗍 by including the Euclid 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍 data vector. We are targeting release of these results alongside or soon after the Flagship Euclid 3𝗑2𝗉𝗍 results. We propose using Euclid RR2 data (available now) as an intermediate step for pipeline validation. These data will not be used for publication.\n\nFigure 1: Overlap of Euclid RR2 and DR1 with the SPT Main and Summer fields, as well as noise levels for the SPT fields.\n\nFigure 2: Figure of merit (FoM) improvements for (Ωm, σ8) when adding Planck and SPT CMB lensing cross-correlation constraints to Euclid weak lensing.",

it is installed as the `run_nx2pt` CLI via the package configuration in `pyproject.toml` (`project.scripts`).\n\n**Package Structure**\n- `tracer.py` defines the data-model layer for all sky tracers, backed by `pymaster.NmtField` objects for maps and catalog samples (`MapTracer`, `CatalogTracer`).\n- `namaster_tools.py` hosts the numerical kernels that build NaMaster workspaces, bin multipoles, and compute coupled/decoupled spectra and covariances.\n- `data.py` packages the outputs (`ClData`) and utilities to bin theory curves and export spectra/covariance information to SACC.\n- `run_nx2pt.py` is the command entry point that loads YAML configuration, instantiates tracers, executes all requested spectra via `compute_cls_cov`, and writes results.\n- `utils.py` supplies lightweight helpers (timed logging, YAML preprocessing, case-insensitive column access) that support the workflow.\n- `maps.py` collects standalone HEALPix helpers for building pixelized map products from catalog positions.\n\n**Tracer Implementations**\n- `Tracer` serves as a non-instantiable base, storing display metadata, optional beams, and spins common to all tracers (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_tracer.py:8`).\n- `MapTracer` turns one or two HEALPix maps plus a mask into a NaMaster field, inferring spin from the number of maps and defaulting to a pixel window beam when none is given (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_tracer.py:21`).\n- `CatalogTracer` wraps `NmtFieldCatalog` / `NmtFieldCatalogClustering`, handling both sampled shear/field measurements and clustering with random catalogs up to a user-specified `lmax` (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_tracer.py:68`).\n- Both tracer types cache the NaMaster field so repeated spectra reuse the expensive object construction, and expose helper attributes such as `noise_est` that the pipeline can read (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:93`).\n\n**Spectra and Covariance Workflow**\n- `compute_cls_cov` loops over requested cross-spectra, pulls cached NaMaster workspaces (hashing masks and spins when a cache directory is provided), computes coupled spectra, and decouples them into bandpowers (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:202`).\n- Optional shot-noise subtraction applies only to same-tracer auto spectra, with spin-aware handling so E and B components are treated correctly (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:212`).\n- Gaussian covariances are built via `nmt.gaussian_covariance`, but catalog-based tracers are currently skipped because the covariance path is not implemented for them (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:247`).\n- Bandpower windows and effective multipoles originate from a configurable binning scheme (`get_ell_bins`) that supports linear, logarithmic, square-root spacing, or explicit edges (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:12`).\n\n**Data Container**\n- `ClData` stores per-pair spectra, bandpower windows, covariances, and optional noise templates and tracer metadata so downstream exporters can populate SACC metadata blocks (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_data.py:59`).\n- Utility accessors (`get_cl`, `get_cov`) understand NaMaster spin conventions and expose individual SACC data types such as `cl_ee` or `cl_0e` (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_data.py:118`).\n- `write_to_sacc` creates a complete SACC file with tracer metadata, spectra, bandpower windows, noise tags, and either block-diagonal or full covariances depending on what was computed (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_data.py:189`).\n- Interpolation helpers allow binning of theory curves into the measured bandpower basis, with options to reset monopole or dipole terms before binning (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_data.py:10`).\n\n**Utility Layer**\n- The `Timer` context manager prints start/stop messages with wall-clock durations—`compute_cls_cov` uses this liberally to make long NaMaster calls transparent (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_utils.py:7`).\n- `preprocess_yaml` lets configuration files include external YAML fragments using `#!include path`, a pattern used extensively in the shearXlensing templates to compose tracer libraries and shared binning blocks (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_utils.py:24`; `code/shearXlensing/nx2pt_files/shear-cmbk-2x2.yaml:1`).\n- `get_ul_key` provides case-insensitive access to Astropy table columns when reading catalogs, avoiding fragile casing assumptions (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_utils.py:48`).\n\n**Command-Line Interface**\n- `run_nx2pt` exposes `--nside` to override the configuration value globally and `--no-cache` to disable workspace caching, otherwise it expects a YAML file defining tracers and requested spectra (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:104`).\n- Workspace caching defaults to the `workspace_dir` path from the YAML and uses `joblib.hash` signatures of mask alm content and spins so repeated jobs can reuse NaMaster coupling matrices (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:51`).\n- The CLI warns when a cross-spectra block has no outputs configured, encouraging users to set either `save_sacc` or (commented) NPZ exports (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:130`).\n\n**Configuration Reference**\n- Top-level keys include `nside`, a default `binning` scheme, and `workspace_dir`; the default binning can point to a named shape or to explicit edges, as shown by the shared `binning.yaml` templates in shearXlensing (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:116`; `cmbx/files/code_shearXlensing_nx2pt_files_binning.yaml:1`).\n- Each tracer entry supplies a human-readable `name`, `data_dir`, optional `bins` and `bins_one_indexed`, and either a `healpix` block (with `map`, `mask`, optional `is_masked`) or a `catalog` block (with `file` plus `fields` or `randoms`) (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:50`; `cmbx/files/code_shearXlensing_nx2pt_files_tracers.yaml:2`).\n- Map tracers accept `beam: pixwin` (auto-computed beam), `use_mask_squared` to square the HEALPix mask before building the NaMaster field, `correct_qu_sign` to flip the Q map, and optional per-bin `noise_est` lists (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:31`; `cmbx/files/code_shearXlensing_nx2pt_files_tracers.yaml:43`).\n- Catalog tracers can provide `fields` for sampled values or `randoms` for clustering plus optional `field_is_weighted`; column names are matched case-insensitively, simplifying reuse across releases (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:70`).\n- Cross-spectra blocks list tracer pairs and allow per-pair overrides such as `binning`, `subtract_noise`, `autos_only`, and `save_nl`; block-level `covariance` toggles Gaussian covariance calculation and `interbin_cov` adds off-diagonal terms, while `save_sacc` controls FITS output and metadata (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:137`; `code/shearXlensing/nx2pt_files/shear-cmbk-2x2.yaml:21`).\n\n**Example Workflow Pattern**\n- The shearXlensing project demonstrates composing a configuration by including shared tracer definitions, pointing individual tracer keys (e.g., `wl`, `ck`) at YAML anchors, and running multiple `cross_spectra*` blocks from a single pipeline file (`code/shearXlensing/nx2pt_files/shear-cmbk-2x2.yaml:13`).\n- Those templates also show how to attach descriptive metadata to SACC outputs so downstream likelihood pipelines can distinguish runs (`code/shearXlensing/nx2pt_files/shear-cmbk-2x2.yaml:33`).\n\n**Notable Limitations**\n- `ClData.from_sacc` and `ClData.from_theory_cls` are placeholders, so ingesting external SACC files still requires manual glue (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_data.py:110`).\n- Covariance calculations skip catalog-based tracers entirely, which is important for mixed map–catalog workflows until the missing logic is implemented (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_namaster_tools.py:247`).\n- The tracer loader references configuration keys via an undefined variable (`config[key]`) when reading beams; this bug needs correction before non-pixwin beams can be loaded reliably (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_run_nx2pt.py:45`).",

      "body": "Euclid × CMB-κ cross-correlation pipeline. The infrastructure works (rules, wildcards, packaging, plots). The spectra are wrong — all negative where they should be positive.\n\n## Desired State\n\nA working, robust cross-correlation pipeline where every detail is either addressed or raised as an open fiber. By comparing against gctools (map-based, working) and sp_validation (catalog-based, reference), converge on an implementation that produces correct, physically sensible spectra. Make as much progress as possible each iteration — fix what you can, file what you can't.\n\n`cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_compute_cross_spectrum.py` produces cross-spectra that:\n\n1. **Start from gctools conventions.** When in doubt, match `spectra.py::map2wlcls` — it's a working implementation that produces correct results. Divergences from gctools are the first place to look when debugging. Once we have broad agreement with Margherita's results (positive C^{Eκ}, sensible shape and amplitude), we can improve: better noise handling, different binning, etc. The point isn't to clone gctools forever — it's to have a known-good baseline to build from.\n\n2. **Produce positive C^{Eκ}_ℓ.** The E-mode shear × CMB convergence cross-spectrum traces the same large-scale matter distribution. It must be positive, with amplitude ~10⁻¹⁰. If it's negative, something is wrong — don't proceed to other work until this is resolved.\n\n3. **Have a resolved sign convention** for the e1/e2 → Q/U mapping, documented in a decision fiber with reasoning. `sign_test_lean.py` tests all 4 combinations on real data; run it if the sign isn't resolved after matching gctools.\n\n4. **Use shape noise from FITS headers** for the shear noise power spectrum. Each shear map header contains `NOISE_CL` (= σ²_comp / n_eff_sr), the flat per-component shape noise Cℓ. Use this as `nl_uncoupled` for WL fields — it replaces Margherita's `None` (which she marked as a TODO) and the BB−EE subtraction trick. For cross-spectra with CMB κ there's no noise bias to subtract (independent experiments), but the auto-spectra fed into the Gaussian covariance should include this noise.\n\n5. **Use iNKA Gaussian covariance** following `spectra.py::get_cov`. Input spectra are coupled auto/cross spectra normalized by mean(mask_i × mask_j). Spins detected from field type. This is the working pattern — don't introduce theory-based covariance yet.\n\n6. **Support catalog-based cross-spectra.** The shear tracer can be constructed directly from the parquet catalog as an `NmtFieldCatalog` (spin-2), crossed with the CMB κ `NmtField` (spin-0). NaMaster handles mixed field types transparently — `compute_coupled_cell` and workspace creation work across NmtFieldCatalog × NmtField as long as lmax matches. This bypasses the map-making step entirely, providing an independent validation path. The catalog-based and map-based cross-spectra should agree; disagreement isolates bugs in map construction vs. spectrum computation.\n\n   The catalog preparation mirrors `build_maps.py`: load the parquet, filter `tom_bin_id == bin` and `she_{method}_weight > 0`, exclude bad tiles (from config), subtract weighted-mean additive bias (c1, c2). Pass `[ra, dec]` as positions (lonlat=True), weights, and `[e1, ±e2]` as fields to `NmtFieldCatalog`. nx2pt already has `CatalogTracer` (`cmbx/files/code_nx2pt_src_nx2pt_tracer.py` line 69) that wraps this.\n\n**Done when:**\n- `C^{Eκ}_ℓ` is positive for lensmc × ACT (the baseline case)\n- Cross-spectrum shape is physically sensible (positive, decaying at high ℓ)\n- Map-based and catalog-based cross-spectra agree (at least for one bin × CMB experiment)\n- Sign convention is documented in a closed decision fiber\n- Systematic null tests re-run and PTEs are reasonable (not all > 0.8)\n- Check: `snakemake -n compute_all_shear_cross_spectra` is clean\n\n## Context\n\n### gctools (authoritative)\n\n`code/dr1_cmbx/src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/gctools/spectra.py` — the working implementation:\n- `map2wlcls()` (line 708): field creation, masking, spectrum computation for WL × CMB-κ\n- `get_cl()` (line 13): coupled → decoupled spectrum, optional noise subtraction via `pnl`\n- `get_cov()` (line 135): iNKA Gaussian covariance, spin-aware\n- `get_spectra()` (line 93): orchestrates fields → spectra, passes `nl_uncoupled` for auto-spectra only\n\n### sp_validation (reference)\n\n`cmbx/files/sp_validation_src_sp_validation_cosmo_val.py` — catalog-based pseudo-Cℓ reference from CosmoStat. Shows the full NaMaster pattern including `NmtFieldCatalog`, analytic noise bias, and theory+noise covariance. Useful for understanding the general pattern; we don't need to match it exactly.\n\n### Shear map noise metadata\n\nFITS headers on `rr2_v2_1_wl_031224_method=lensmc_bin={n}_shear_maps.fits` contain:\n```\nNOISE_CL   — flat shape noise Cℓ (σ²_comp / n_eff_sr)\nSIG_EPS    — total ellipticity dispersion\nSIG_COMP   — per-component dispersion (σ_ε / √2)\nNEFF_SR    — effective galaxy density [sr⁻¹]\n```\n\n### Catalog-based pseudo-Cℓ\n\n`NmtFieldCatalog` takes positions, weights, and field values directly — no map-making. For shear × CMB-κ, the shear side is catalog-based and the CMB side is map-based.

Shear fields constructed with `[-e1, e2]` sign convention — the standard WL frame, transforming Euclid RA-aligned ellipticities to HEALPix colatitude-aligned Q/U. Masks: binary footprint apodized with `nmt.mask_apodization(mask, 0.15, \"C2\")`, then multiplied by weight map. CMB κ masks apodized identically following gctools convention. NaMaster workspace computes mode-coupling matrix; spectrum decoupled from mask effects.\n\n**Covariance.** Two estimates computed for each spectrum: (1) NaMaster Gaussian (iNKA), validated against Knox (median ratio 1.04 density, 1.26 shear after fixing an interleaved diagonal extraction bug). (2) Knox formula: `Var = C^{aa} · C^{bb} / n_modes` with effective fsky from Hivon (2002). Knox is primary for chi2/PTE/A_lens (avoids coupling matrix artifact at last bandpower); NaMaster for plot error bars.\n\n**Evidence.** Each spectrum produces a per-wildcard evidence JSON with SNR, chi2_null (test against zero signal), dof, PTE.

SACC (Save All Cross-Correlations) is the standard Euclid/LSST data vector format — the interface between spectrum estimation and parameter inference.\n\n**Why SACC.** SACC files carry not just data vectors but also tracer metadata (n(z), beam functions), bandpower definitions, and covariance blocks. This is what the eDR1like likelihood reads. The format enables sharing spectra with the wider Euclid/LSST community and ensures that all information needed to compute theory predictions is bundled with the data.\n\n**Tracers.** 14 shear tracers as NZTracer (z, n(z) from `RR2_v2_Nz_WL_C2020_sel_pv.fits`, 6 bins + \"all\" bin × 2 methods). 1 CMB κ tracer as MiscTracer (no n(z) — CMB lensing has a broad kernel computed internally by the theory code). Total: 15 tracers per file. Originally used MiscTracer for shear (with no n(z)), upgraded to NZTracer when likelihood integration required redshift distributions.\n\n**Data vector.** 560 data points per SACC file (14 cross-spectra × 40 bandpowers each — 20 E-mode + 20 B-mode). 20 log-spaced bins from ℓ=40 to ℓ=3000 (decision: `bandpower-binning-20-log-spaced-3628f69e`).\n\n**Covariance.** Block diagonal Knox covariance included. Off-diagonal blocks (cross-bin, cross-method correlations) not computed — this is a limitation for joint inference but sufficient for per-spectrum significance tests. The full joint covariance used by `evaluate_fiducial_likelihood` comes from the PKL files (`build_likelihood_input`), not from SACC.\n\n**Downstream.** SACC files feed into `validate_sacc` (completeness check) and were intended for `eDR1like` likelihood evaluation. In practice, the eDR1like pipeline reads PKL format (see `edr1like-likelihood-reads-pkl-a6201d1d`), so SACC files are a reference format and exchange medium, while PKL provides the actual likelihood input.\n\n**Script**: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_combine_cross_spectra.py`",

Both ACT and SPT, both lensmc and metacal.\n\n## Corrected understanding (iteration 7)\n\n**Amplitude comparison was misleading.** Margherita's reference pickle (`cls_kggg_eRR2_...`) contains *galaxy density × κ* cross-correlations (`kappa_g0`, `g0_g0`, etc.) at ~10^-7 level. Our shear × κ at ~10^-10 is the expected order of magnitude for cosmic shear. The \"30-50× too small\" claim was comparing apples to oranges.\n\n**The sign is the real issue.** All 28 spectra have negative E-mode weighted mean:\n- Signal grows more negative at higher z: bin1 ~ -4e-9, bin6 ~ -1.6e-8\n- High-z bins detected at SNR 4-6 but with wrong sign\n- ACT convention confirmed standard (positive κ = overdensity)\n\n## Root cause analysis: (e1, e2) → (Q, U) mapping\n\nBoth our code and Margherita's gctools use `[e1, -e2]` for NaMaster NmtField creation. NaMaster docs say this is the correct mapping for IAU convention (e1 along Dec, e2 flipped for sense-of-rotation). But this assumes the catalog stores e1 along *declination* (IAU).\n\n**If Euclid stores e1 along RA** (standard weak lensing convention: e1 > 0 = stretched E-W), then the correct mapping to HEALPix (Q, U) is `[-e1, e2]`:\n- Standard WL to IAU is a 90° rotation: Q_IAU = -e1, U_IAU = -e2\n- IAU to HEALPix: Q_HP = Q_IAU, U_HP = -U_IAU\n- So: [Q_HP, U_HP] = [-e1, e2]\n- Our `[e1, -e2]` = `[-Q_HP, -U_HP]` → synthetic test confirms this gives negative E\n\n**Synthetic NaMaster test at nside=64** (correlated κ + shear with known positive C_l^{κE}):\n- `[+Q, +U]`: E = +6.9e-8 (POSITIVE, correct)\n- `[+Q, -U]`: E = +2.2e-9 (weakly positive)\n- `[-Q, +U]`: E = -2.2e-9 (negative)\n- `[-Q, -U]`: E = -6.9e-8 (NEGATIVE — matches our observation)\n\n## Diagnostic in progress\n\n`workflow/scripts/sign_test_lean.py` — tests all 4 sign combos on real lensmc bin5 × ACT data at nside=64. Left running (I/O-limited on cluster filesystem loading the 400MB ACT kappa map). Script reads sparse shear maps efficiently, downgrades immediately to nside=64.\n\n## Open question: what is Euclid's e1/e2 convention?\n\nThe DPDD XML schema (`euc-she.xml`) defines `SHE_GENERIC_E1_CORRECTED` as \"corrected first component of ellipticity\" without specifying the reference direction. Need to check:\n1. The LensMC paper (Congedo et al.) for convention definition\n2. The SHE-WL pipeline documentation\n3. Or just let the `sign_test_lean.py` diagnostic resolve it empirically\n\n## Next steps\n1. Wait for `sign_test_lean.py` to complete → tells which combo gives positive E\n2. If `[-e1, e2]` wins: fix `make_shear_field()` in `compute_cross_spectrum.py`\n3. Rerun one spectrum via Snakemake to verify\n4.

Three possible source conventions:\n\n| Convention | e1 reference | To NaMaster |\n|---|---|---|\n| IAU (e1 along Dec/North) | North | `[e1, -e2]` |\n| Standard WL (e1 along RA/East) | East | `[-e1, e2]` |\n| HEALPix (e1 along colatitude/South) | South | `[e1, e2]` |\n\nBoth our code and Margherita's gctools use `[e1, -e2]`, assuming IAU. But the standard weak lensing convention (DES, HSC, KiDS) defines e1 along RA.\n\n## Derivation (if standard WL convention)\n\nReference frame rotation from East to South = +π/2:\n- Q_IAU = e1 cos(2·π/2) + e2 sin(2·π/2) = -e1\n- U_IAU = -e1 sin(2·π/2) + e2 cos(2·π/2) = -e2\n- Q_HP = Q_IAU = -e1, U_HP = -U_IAU = e2\n- NaMaster input: `[-e1, e2]`\n\nOur current `[e1, -e2]` = `[-Q_HP, -U_HP]` → explains the negative E-mode.\n\n## Evidence\n\n**Synthetic test:** At nside=64 with known positive C_l^{κE}:\n- `[Q, U]` → +6.9e-8 (correct)\n- `[-Q, -U]` → -6.9e-8 (our current result, negative)\n\n**Real data:** All 28 spectra negative, signal grows with z (real cosmological signal with wrong sign).\n\n**ACT convention:** Confirmed standard (positive κ = overdensity). Not the issue.\n\n## Diagnostic\n\n`workflow/scripts/sign_test_lean.py` — runs all 4 combos on real lensmc bin5 × ACT at nside=64. Left running (slow cluster I/O). Should resolve empirically which combo gives positive E.\n\n**Killed twice by OOM on login node** (loading 400MB ACT kappa map). Needs to run as a SLURM job, or the script needs to be modified to use `dtype=np.float32` and/or read ACT kappa at lower resolution. Alternatively, add as a Snakemake rule with `mem_mb=8000`.\n\nRun it (needs compute node or more memory):\n```bash\nsingularity exec --bind /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083 \\\n    /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083/cdaley00/container \\\n    python workflow/scripts/sign_test_lean.py\n```\n\n## What would change\n\nIf fix is `[-e1, e2]`:\n1. `compute_cross_spectrum.py:make_shear_field()` line 77: `[e1, -e2]` → `[-e1, e2]`\n2. `compute_systematic_cross_spectrum.py`: same pattern\n3. All 28 cross-spectra and 70 systematics need recomputation\n4. Evidence/PTE values will change (may resolve the \"suspiciously good PTE\" issue too)\n\nNote: Margherita's gctools also uses `[e1, -e2]` for the same shear maps. If this is wrong, both codes have the same bug. (Galaxy density × κ is spin-0 so unaffected.)\n\n## Alternative: maybe Euclid IS IAU convention\n\nIf the SHE pipeline defines e1 along declination (IAU), then `[e1, -e2]` is correct and the negative signal has a different cause. Need to resolve by:\n1. Checking SHE/LensMC documentation for the convention definition\n2. Or the empirical diagnostic (sign_test_lean.py)",
      "outcome": "Resolved empirically. Applied [-e1, e2] mapping and all cross-spectra turned positive. Euclid e1 is along RA (standard WL convention). The derivation in the body of this fiber was correct: rotation RA→colatitude = +π/2 gives Q=-e1, U=e2. Note: gctools also uses [e1, -e2] — this is a latent bug there too, only visible in spin-2 × spin-0 cross-spectra (shear auto-spectra are sign-invariant).",

The tapestry is the analysis.\n\n## Desired State\n\n### The tapestry\n\nEvery snakemake rule that produces a plot or evidence has a **claim fiber** with a `tapestry:{rule_name}` tag. The specName matches the snakemake rule name, linking fiber → `results/claims/{rule_name}/evidence.json` → plots. Each fiber's outcome describes what was found, whether it's sensible, and what assumptions underlie it. Open questions are filed as investigation or question fibers. Decisions about methodology get decision fibers. The DAG of fibers mirrors the DAG of the analysis — walking `felt upstream` from any result should explain how we got there.\n\nEvidence + plots co-located in `results/claims/{rule_name}/`. Staleness propagates via evidence.json mtimes. See `/tapestry` skill for rendering details.\n\nCheck coverage: `grep -l 'tapestry:' .felt/*.md` vs the list of rules in `workflow/Snakefile` and `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`. Gaps are work.\n\n### Specific analyses\n\nThe pipeline should produce and document these comparisons. Each is a snakemake rule (or set of rules) with plots, evidence, and a claim fiber:\n\n- **ACT vs SPT cross-spectra** — same shear bins crossed with different CMB experiments. Are they consistent? Differences reveal CMB-side systematics. Plot: side-by-side or ratio, per bin.\n- **lensmc vs metacal** — same CMB × different shear methods. Consistency validates shear measurement. Plot: overlay or difference, per bin × CMB.\n- **Redshift trend** — C^{Eκ}_ℓ vs tomographic bin. Signal should increase with bin number (lensing kernel overlap). Plot: all bins on one panel per CMB experiment.\n- **B-mode null test** — C^{Bκ}_ℓ should be consistent with noise. Elevated B-modes signal systematics or E→B leakage (documented in `eb-leakage-inflates-b-mode-800dcbf4` — note fsky effects).\n- **Systematic contamination tests (expanded)** — following DES×SPT (2203.12440, §A.4, Eq. A.4.1), compute the harmonic-space contamination metric:\n\n  X^f_S(ℓ) = C^{κS}_ℓ · C^{fS}_ℓ / C^{SS}_ℓ\n\n  where S is a systematic map, f is the Euclid tracer (shear or density), and κ is CMB convergence. This has the same units as C^{fκ}_ℓ and can be compared directly to the signal. It's zero unless the systematic correlates with *both* tracers simultaneously — the key insight for cross-correlations.\n\n  The DES×SPT test is done in configuration space (angular correlation functions). The harmonic-space version requires care: C^{SS}_ℓ in the denominator has noise bias from pixelization and sparse sampling of the systematic maps. This must be understood or debiased — noise inflates the denominator and makes contamination look smaller than it is. Options: use the Knox noise estimate for the systematic auto, or subtract an analytical noise floor. Document the choice.\n\n  **What to compute and plot per systematic:**\n  - C^{fS}_ℓ — shear × systematic (currently done)\n  - C^{κS}_ℓ — CMB κ × systematic (new — add as a snakemake rule)\n  - X^f_S(ℓ) — the combined contamination metric\n  - Compare X to the statistical uncertainty on C^{fκ}_ℓ (DES×SPT uses 1–10% of σ as a reference band)\n\n  **Summary statistic**: χ²/dof and PTE for X^f_S consistent with zero. DES×SPT uses PTE > 0.01 as the threshold for concern. Galactic extinction is known to contaminate (fiber `galactic-extinction-ecfc9972`); others should be clean.\n- **Theory comparison** — measured C^{Eκ}_ℓ overplotted with theoretical prediction from `eDR1like.Theory` (CCL/CAMB). Validates amplitude, shape, and redshift dependence. Requires choosing fiducial cosmology + bias model — document choices in decision fibers.\n- **Covariance documentation** — a fiber (or set of fibers) describing how the covariance is calculated: what approximation (Knox, iNKA, Gaussian), what input spectra, what fsky, what noise model. Every assumption explicit. The Knox formula is primary for systematic null tests; iNKA Gaussian (NaMaster) for signal covariance. Document why, and what the known limitations are.\n- **Catalog vs map agreement** — already done (fiber `catalog-cross-spectra-validate-c2ced916`), but should have a summary plot rule if it doesn't already.\n\n### Plot quality\n\nEvery plot should be publication-ready: clear axis labels (ℓ, ℓC_ℓ), consistent color scheme (`sns.set_palette(\"husl\", n)`), error bars from the covariance diagonal, legend identifying what's shown. Formatting issues are bugs — fix them when found.\n\n### Assumptions register\n\nMethodology choices accumulate in decision fibers. Each should state what was chosen, why, and what alternatives exist. Examples already filed: sign convention, CMB mask treatment, plot scaling, noise model. New ones emerge as the analysis deepens. Check `felt ls --all | grep decision` for the current state.\n\n### Fiber content and connectivity\n\nClaim fibers should be substantive, not just tags with outcomes. Each claim fiber needs:\n\n- **Body text** describing what the analysis does, what it tests, what assumptions it relies on, and what was found. Currently 15/16 tapestry fibers have zero body content — they're titles + outcomes only. The body is what makes the tapestry readable by a human walking the graph.\n- **Inter-fiber dependencies** matching the Snakemake DAG. Currently every claim fiber depends only on the spec fiber — the tapestry view shows isolated nodes with no edges between them. Claim fibers should link to their upstream claims (e.g., `plot_theory_comparison` depends on `compute_theory_cls` and `compute_cross_spectrum`; `plot_contamination_metric` depends on `compute_cmbk_systematic_cross_spectrum` and `compute_systematic_cross_spectrum`). The felt DAG should mirror the analysis DAG.\n- **Evidence files** at `results/claims/{rule_name}/evidence.json` with quantitative metrics. The evidence pipeline is being extended to cover all comparison rules (method_comparison, theory_comparison, redshift_trend, contamination_metric, systematic_null_tests, catalog_validation_summary).\n\n### What \"done\" means\n\nThis loop has no stopping criterion — the analysis extends over months. Each iteration should make progress: add a fiber, improve a plot, document an assumption, add a comparison, fix a formatting issue, explore something in Margherita's code or the docs. File open questions for the user when taste or judgment is needed.\n\nThe tapestry is done when every detail is either addressed or raised. Since research generates new questions faster than it answers them, this is an asymptote, not a destination.\n\n### Authority\n\nThe loop has full authority to decide implementation details — rule structure, plot design, binning choices, covariance methods, etc. When a decision requires taste or domain judgment, file it as an open child fiber (`-t question`) so the user can weigh in. But make a preliminary choice so progress continues — the fiber records the question, the code records the working answer. Both can be revised later.\n\n## Context\n\n### Existing fibers\n\n`felt ls --all` shows ~48 fibers. Many are closed with outcomes from the v2 pipeline loop. The tapestry builds on these — don't re-derive what's documented, but do check that existing fibers are still accurate and well-connected.\n\n### Code references\n\n- **gctools** (authoritative masking/spectra): `code/dr1_cmbx/src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/gctools/spectra.py`\n- **eDR1like** (theory predictions): `cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1like_theory.py` — CCL/CAMB theory Cℓ with bias models, IA, magnification.

Check with `snakemake-peek <session>`. Sleep between checks rather than polling — `sleep 120 && snakemake-peek smk-XXXXXX`.\n\n### Steering decisions (2026-02-15)\n\n- **Full contamination metric**: Implement X = C^{κS}·C^{fS}/C^{SS}. Start with raw C^{SS} (lower bound on contamination), document noise caveat. Debias later.\n- **Validation tests**: Pick up the unimplemented tests from `cmbx/files/docs_validation_tests.txt` — jackknife, curl maps, cross-shear γ_x, spatial patches. These are in scope for this loop, not deferred.\n- **Theory**: Vanilla Planck 2018 is sufficient. Don't explore IA/magnification/bias — the current comparison serves its purpose.\n- **SPT estimators**: Run TT, PP, MV comparisons. Add as cmbk wildcards.\n- **Mass maps**: Download 2D mass maps from PIC (`https://shared.euclid.pic.es:8453/tr1/WL/euclid_tr1_le3_v1_1/2D_MASS/`). Adapt `inputs/euclid/download_tr1_systematics.sh`.\n- **No `--forceall`**: Trust the DAG. Never use `--touch --forceall`.\n\n### Iteration 10 findings\n\n- **Theory amplitude deficit discovered**: A<1 for both ACT (0.83±0.05) and SPT (0.70±0.05). ACT shape OK after amplitude fit; SPT shape fails. Common deficit = missing IA/calibration; SPT-specific deficit = CMB-side normalization. New rule `plot_theory_residual_analysis` + tapestry node.\n- **20 tapestry nodes** — complete coverage, all fresh evidence.\n- **n(z) plots reformatted** — \"Provenance TBD\" removed, titles corrected, bin legends added, re-run on SLURM.\n- **Open question filed**: `theory-amplitude-a-1-pursue-ia-ce5252d7` — pursue IA prediction or SPT normalization investigation?\n\n### Iteration 20 findings\n\n- **Systematic bias budget implemented**: New `plot_systematic_budget` rule — heatmap of S_bias = sqrt(Σ X²/σ²) per (systematic, bin, CMB). 27th tapestry node.\n- **Stellar density is ACT's dominant contaminant**: max 4.4σ (lensmc) / 8.0σ (metacal). Worse than galactic extinction (3.7σ/5.8σ). Not apparent from C^{γS} null tests alone — the bias significance weights by correlation with *both* tracers.\n- **ACT vs SPT asymmetry in contamination**: ACT has 22/48 entries >1σ, SPT has 2/48. Driven by ACT's larger sky coverage admitting more galactic contamination.\n- **Metacal shows 2× higher bias than lensmc**: Different shear weights couple differently to galactic systematics. Needs investigation.\n- **Bias is a lower bound**: C^{SS} noise-biased high → X denominator inflated → true bias could be worse.\n- **Question filed**: `act-systematic-bias-exceeds-1a76bb12` — ACT bin 1 bias (8σ) exceeds signal (5.5σ). Mitigation needed for parameter inference.\n- **Analysis summary updated** with budget annotation in panel (c): \"Stellar 4.4σ max, Gal. ext. 3.7σ max\".\n\n### Iteration 21 findings\n\n- **Template deprojection implemented**: New `plot_deprojected_spectra` rule — subtract X_total = Σ_S C^{κS}·C^{fS}/C^{SS} from C^{Eκ} and re-fit A_hat(IA). 28th tapestry node.\n- **Contamination BOOSTS ACT signal**: X_total is predominantly positive (same sign as signal). Subtracting it makes A_hat worse (further from 1), not better. ACT lensmc: 0.93→0.80 (Δ=-2.5σ). ACT metacal: 0.89→0.68 (Δ=-3.6σ).\n- **Bin 1 (ACT) is ~70% contamination**: A_hat drops 1.07→0.26 after deprojection. The stellar density contamination carried most of the measured signal.\n- **Bin 5 (ACT) moderately contaminated**: A_hat drops 1.03→0.77 (S_bias=11σ).\n- **SPT is clean**: Negligible change (<0.1σ) for both methods. SPT deficit (A=0.76) is intrinsic, not systematic.\n- **Metacal more affected than lensmc**: metacal Δ=-0.21 vs lensmc Δ=-0.13 for ACT. Different shear weights couple differently to galactic systematics.\n- **Implications for parameter inference**: ACT bins 1 and 5 should be excluded or treated with contamination marginalization. SPT is the cleaner dataset. ACT 20σ detection inflated ~14% by systematic signal.\n- **Analysis summary updated** with deprojection annotation on panel (d).\n\n### Iteration 22 findings\n\n- **Deprojected likelihood evaluation**: New `evaluate_deprojected_likelihood` rule — joint 6-bin chi2 on deprojected spectra using full covariance from PKL files. 29th tapestry node.\n- **ACT original good fit was coincidental**: ACT lensmc chi2/dof worsens from 0.88 (PTE 0.82) → 2.44 (PTE 0.00) after deprojection. ACT metacal even worse: 0.96 → 5.51. The systematic contamination was making ACT spectra look MORE like Planck 2018 + NLA IA theory.\n- **S/N counterintuitively increases**: ACT lensmc S/N goes 20→22σ, metacal 19→28σ after deprojection. This arises from non-diagonal covariance structure — worth further investigation but doesn't affect qualitative conclusions.\n- **SPT confirms cleanliness**: SPT chi2/dof unchanged (1.88→1.85 lensmc, 1.67→1.69 metacal). SPT deficit is CMB-side, not contamination.\n- **ACT bias question closed**: Recommendation: bins 1+5 unreliable, SPT preferred for parameter inference, lensmc preferred over metacal for ACT. Original ACT 20σ detection ~14% inflated.\n- **Analysis summary updated** with deprojected likelihood chi2 + Â on panel (d).\n\n### Iteration 23 findings\n\n- **Template marginalization resolves S/N paradox**: Naive template subtraction injected template noise into chi2 (X^T C^{-1} X >> 2·d^T C^{-1} X for noisy templates from C^{SS} denominator). Replaced with joint Fisher matrix fit: d = A*theory + Σ α_S*X_S. Marginalized S/N properly decreases: ACT 20→15σ, SPT 21→14σ.\n- **\"Coincidental good fit\" was an artifact**: Naive chi2 worsening (0.88→2.44) was dominated by template noise injection. Marginalized profile chi2/dof=0.75 (PTE 0.98) — ACT signal IS consistent with Planck 2018 + NLA IA after proper contamination handling. This is a significant qualitative revision from iteration 22.\n- **ACT contamination modest**: Â(IA) moves 0.93→0.86±0.06 (marginalized, 1.2σ from unity), not 0.93→0.80 (naive, 2.5σ). ACT metacal: 0.89→0.82±0.06 (1.2σ). Both methods now consistent with theory.\n- **SPT deficit confirmed intrinsic**: Profile chi2/dof=1.6 persists after marginalization. SPT normalization issue is CMB-side.\n- **Template amplitudes diagnostic**: ACT α_stellar~0.4, α_gal_ext~0.5. SPT α values poorly constrained (low contamination signal → unconstrained Fisher directions).\n- **S/N question fiber closed**: `deprojection-s-n-increase-dc7a64b4` resolved with analytical decomposition + numerical verification.\n- **Analysis summary updated**: Panel (d) now shows \"After marginalized\" annotation with corrected Â and chi2 values.\n\n## Skills\n\n- `/tapestry` — **always run this skill** to understand how fibers, evidence, and plots connect in the DAG visualization.

The residuals are mostly within ±10% even at noisy bandpowers. Median chi2/dof = 0.14 — suspiciously tight, but expected. The two methods share the *same galaxies* and the *same CMB map*, so their noise is highly correlated. The Knox formula assumes independent noise realizations; applied to the difference of correlated measurements it dramatically overestimates the variance, deflating chi2. This test confirms consistency but has limited discriminating power.

What changed is presentation and statistical calibration: the pipeline now reports one legible figure and one rule-level evidence file, rather than a wildcard gallery and dozens of sidecar evidence files that collaborators do not consume.\n\nThis formalization reduces exploration clutter and aligns the rule with the constitution principle that plot outputs should be compressed into collaborator-readable composites.

The contamination metric is non-zero only if a systematic correlates with *both* κ and the Euclid tracer simultaneously. C^{κS} measures whether the systematic leaks into the CMB lensing reconstruction (e.g. dust biasing the CMB gradient estimator).\n\n**Results.** 25 spectra (5 sysmaps × 5 CMB experiments).

This is diagonal — no bandpower-to-bandpower correlations.\n\n**Inputs.** C^{aa} and C^{bb} are the auto-spectra of the two fields. For shear × CMB κ: C^{γγ} includes shape noise (`NOISE_CL` from FITS headers), C^{κκ} includes reconstruction noise. fsky_eff computed from the apodized product of both masks.\n\n**When it works.** Accurate at all fsky when the Gaussian approximation holds (random Gaussian fields, no survey geometry effects). Primary for systematic null tests where the signal is zero by construction — the Knox formula with actual auto-spectra gives properly calibrated chi2/dof ~ 1 under H0.\n\n**Known limitation.** Missing off-diagonal terms (bandpower-to-bandpower coupling from the mask), super-sample variance. These matter for parameter inference but not for null tests.\n\n## NaMaster Gaussian (iNKA)\n\nNaMaster's `gaussian_covariance()` computes the full Gaussian covariance including mode-coupling from the survey mask. In principle more accurate than Knox for structured masks.\n\n**Validation at our sky fractions.** An earlier apparent 10-130× overestimate was traced to an interleaved diagonal extraction bug for spin-2 × spin-0 fields (`namaster-covariance-interleaved-434112b9`). After fixing extraction (reshape to `(nbins, n_cls, nbins, n_cls)` and selecting component 0), NaMaster/Knox = 1.04 (density), 1.26 (shear). The >1 ratio is expected from mask mode-coupling mixing power between bins. One known artifact remains: the last bandpower (ℓ≈2700) has NaMaster variance ~1000× below Knox due to coupling matrix numerics at the edge of the ℓ range.\n\n**Use case.** NaMaster for plot error bars (captures mode coupling beyond the Knox diagonal). Knox for all chi2/PTE/A_lens quantitative inference (avoids the last-bandpower artifact).\n\n## Choice rationale\n\nKnox is primary for signal detection and null tests. NaMaster provides a cross-check and richer error bars for visualization. For full parameter inference with eDR1like, the Knox diagonal is a conservative starting point; full NaMaster (now validated) or simulation-based covariance would tighten constraints. The B-mode covariance remains problematic: NaMaster Gaussian BB underestimates by 15-150× at partial sky due to E→B leakage not captured by the Gaussian approximation (`namaster-gaussian-covariance-9373b1fa`).",

We cross-correlate five systematic maps (stellar density, galactic extinction, exposures, zodiacal light, SAA) with the Euclid shear field across all six tomographic bins and test consistency with zero using Knox-formula variance. Galactic extinction fails decisively in the highest-redshift bins (chi2/dof up to 7.9), with broadband ±3–5σ pulls — but the remaining four systematics scatter within ±1σ. The shear field is contaminated at a level that is detectable in pairwise correlation but, as the bias budget shows, translates to sub-percent per-bandpower bias in the cross-correlation with CMB lensing.\n\nThe 2×3 panel shows per-bandpower pulls (C^{fS}_ℓ / σ_Knox) for all five systematics across six tomographic bins. Under the null hypothesis, pulls scatter around zero with unit variance. Coherent excursions beyond ±2σ indicate contamination; their multipole structure reveals where in harmonic space the systematic leaks in.\n\n**Galactic extinction stands out.** In bins 5 and 6 (highest redshift), the pink pulls reach ±3-5σ across a broad range of multipoles — this is broadband contamination, not a feature at a specific angular scale. The chi2/dof climbs to 7.9 in bin 6. Lower bins show milder excursions (chi2/dof 1.5-2.3). The physical mechanism: Galactic dust affects PSF modeling and photometric calibration, imprinting a large-scale pattern on the shear maps.\n\n**Other systematics are clean.** Stellar density, exposures, SAA, and zodiacal light all scatter within the ±1σ band in most bins. Stellar density shows occasional 2σ excursions but no coherent spectral pattern — its null test looks benign. This is misleading: the bias budget analysis (`plot_systematic_budget`) reveals stellar density is actually the *dominant* ACT contaminant, because its correlation with CMB κ is stronger than galactic extinction's. The null test only measures C^{fS} (shear × systematic); the full contamination diagnostic requires C^{κS} as well.\n\n**What this test cannot see.** A systematic that correlates with CMB κ but not with shear does not appear here. The [contamination metric](.felt/contamination-metric-product-c-e55501f4.md) captures the joint effect — even galactic extinction's alarming null test failures translate to sub-percent per-bandpower bias, because the triple coincidence required for cross-correlation contamination is rarer than pairwise correlations suggest.

The complement to the summary heatmap in `plot_catalog_validation_summary` — here you see the full ℓ-dependence, not just summary statistics.\n\n**Why this matters.** The map-based pipeline converts catalogs to pixelized maps (nside 2048) before computing spectra via NaMaster. This introduces potential biases: sub-pixel averaging, weight map artifacts, and pixelization window function effects. The catalog-based pipeline (`NmtFieldCatalog`) bypasses all of this — it works directly from galaxy positions and ellipticities. Agreement between the two confirms that map-making is not introducing artifacts. This is especially important for the low-number-density high-z bins where pixel occupancy is sparse.\n\n**Layout.** Single panel per comparison. Both spectra overlaid with shared x-axis (ℓ) and ℓ·C_ℓ scaling. Error bars from map-based Knox covariance (no covariance available for catalog-based, since NaMaster doesn't support covariance for NmtFieldCatalog). The visual comparison is the primary diagnostic — differences should be invisible compared to error bars.\n\n**28 comparisons.** Differences are sub-percent in well-measured bandpowers. Any visible discrepancy at high ℓ is consistent with noise — catalog-based and map-based spectra use different internal representations of the same underlying field.

PP (polarization-only) is immune to tSZ — the dominant CMB foreground at cluster scales — because tSZ is unpolarized. TT (temperature-only) is maximally sensitive. GMV (minimum-variance) uses all quadratic pairs, combining both channels. Differences between these estimators in cross-correlation with Euclid shear isolate foreground contamination in the lensing reconstruction.\n\nThe composite plot shows difference spectra relative to PP: TT minus PP (salmon) and GMV minus PP (teal) for each tomographic bin. This design isolates the tSZ-sensitive component directly — a nonzero TT minus PP would indicate foreground bias entering through the temperature channel. All 24 null tests (2 methods x 6 bins x 2 difference curves) are consistent with zero (median chi2/dof = 0.30, min PTE = 0.927, 0/24 failures at 5%).\n\nThe reduced chi2 of 0.30 is expected rather than anomalous. TT, PP, and GMV cross-spectra with the same Euclid shear field share galaxy-side noise — the identical galaxy realization contributes to all three. The difference (e.g. TT minus PP) cancels this common component, but the error bars computed as sqrt(sigma_TT^2 + sigma_PP^2) treat them as independent, double-counting the shared noise that actually cancels. The true variance of the difference is sigma_TT^2 + sigma_PP^2 - 2*cov(TT,PP), which is smaller. This makes the test conservative (overestimated error bars, underestimated chi2) but not invalid — a test that never false-alarms is still a valid null test, just less powerful than it could be. Proper error bars would require the inter-estimator covariance, which we lack.\n\nThis means tSZ contamination of the SPT lensing reconstruction does not bias the shear times kappa cross-correlation at current noise levels. The SPT normalization deficit (A_lens approximately 0.70) cannot be explained by foreground leakage — it persists identically across all four estimators, including the foreground-immune PP channel.",

Yet ACT and SPT cross-spectra agree with each other: 14/14 consistent at 5%, median PTE = 0.64.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- lensmc × ACT: total chi2/dof = 114.1/120 = 0.95, PTE = 0.63\n- lensmc × SPT-GMV: total chi2/dof = 249.0/120 = 2.08, PTE ≈ 0\n- Per-bin SPT chi2 inflated across all bins (37.5, 56.0, 42.5, 30.3, 33.5, 49.2 for dof=20)\n- Also fails for SPT TT/PP/MV variants — not estimator-specific\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n1. **Knox error bars too tight for SPT.** The Knox formula uses `Var = |C^{EE}| × |C^{κκ}| / n_modes`. If SPT has lower reconstruction noise (smaller `C^{κκ}_auto`), the Knox error bars shrink, inflating chi2 for the same theory-data residuals. Need to compare `C^{κκ}_auto` for ACT vs SPT.\n\n2. **fsky_cross difference.** SPT winter field has different sky overlap with Euclid than ACT DR6. Smaller overlap → fewer modes → larger Knox variance (which would REDUCE chi2). This goes the wrong direction — so noise properties dominate if this hypothesis is wrong.\n\n3. **SPT lensing calibration offset.** The SPT maps may have a different lensing response normalization. A multiplicative bias would shift all cross-spectra systematically relative to theory while leaving ACT-SPT ratios consistent (if both are miscalibrated similarly). But ACT-SPT agreement at the difference level argues against this.\n\n4. **Binning mismatch.** The theory curves are computed and binned identically for both CMB experiments. No mechanism for binning to differ.\n\n## Findings\n\n**Knox variance ratio (lensmc bin4):** SPT/ACT = 0.70 (median across bandpowers). SPT error bars are ~84% the size of ACT's. This explains part of the chi2 inflation: for identical residuals, SPT chi2 would be ~1.42× ACT's. Actual ratio is ~2.2×, so the residuals also differ (noise realization + possible systematic).\n\n**Interpretation:** SPT has tighter statistical constraints on the cross-spectrum. A vanilla Planck 2018 theory (no IA, no magnification bias, no multiplicative shear calibration) is \"good enough\" for ACT's noise level but fails when tested against SPT's tighter constraints. This may not indicate a problem with SPT — rather, it reveals that the theory model is insufficient at SPT's statistical power. The ACT comparison passes because it has less power to detect the discrepancy.\n\n## Amplitude fit analysis (iteration 10)\n\nImplemented `plot_theory_residual_analysis` rule. Fits A_hat per bin×cmbk. See fiber `theory-residual-analysis-6a66a995` for full results.\n\n**Key finding: it's both calibration AND shape.**\n\n- ACT mean A = 0.83 ± 0.05 (3.3σ low); shape chi2 good after fit (PTE 0.73-0.83)\n- SPT mean A = 0.70 ± 0.05 (6.5σ low); shape chi2 still fails (PTE < 0.001)\n- Method-independent: lensmc ≈ metacal for both CMB experiments\n\nThe ~17% common deficit (A < 1 for both ACT and SPT) is consistent with missing IA in the theory. The additional ~15% SPT deficit is CMB-side — possibilities: (1) lensing response normalization, (2) noise debiasing, (3) effective ℓ weighting from noise/mask differences.\n\nSPT shape failure concentrated in low-z bins (1-3), improving at high-z (5-6). Consistent with scale-dependent modeling deficiency (IA, baryonic feedback) that ACT's larger errors can't detect.\n\n## Resolution\n\nAll hypotheses have been pursued through subsequent analysis:\n\n- ~~Check if SPT residuals are systematically biased vs scattered~~ → **Done** (iteration 10). Both: multiplicative offset + shape failure.\n- ~~Add IA to theory and see if SPT chi2 improves~~ → **Done** (iteration 13). NLA IA (A_IA=1.72, eta=-0.41) resolves ACT (A=0.93, 1.3σ from 1). SPT improves 0.69→0.76 but 4.9σ deficit persists. See `nla-intrinsic-alignment-cb1dea0b`.\n- ~~Template marginalization~~ → **Done** (iteration 23). Systematic contamination is negligible for SPT (<0.1σ shift). Deficit is intrinsic. See `template-deprojection-a1621797`.\n- ~~Per-bin structure~~ → **Done** (iteration 27). Bins 1–3 fail shape (chi2_shape/dof=1.7–2.7), bins 4–6 pass shape (1.2–1.6). Low-z shape failure consistent with SPT lmin=500 filtering. See `spt-deficit-bin-level-structure-de2540dd`.\n- Check SPT lensing response normalization documentation → **Not pursued** (requires SPT team).\n- Compare ACT vs SPT C^{κκ}_auto → **Partially done**: Knox variance ratio SPT/ACT=0.70 confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The original observation decomposed into (1) common IA suppression (~10%, resolved by NLA IA) + (2) SPT-specific normalization (~24%, CMB-side, not addressable from Euclid side). Low-z shape failure points to SPT reconstruction filtering at lmin=500. Investigation is as complete as possible without SPT team input.",

      "body": "The eDR1like likelihood (`likelihood_pyccl.py`) is a Cobaya-compatible Bayesian parameter inference engine. Understanding its data format expectations is essential for bridging our analysis outputs to parameter constraints.\n\n## What the likelihood expects\n\nThe `LikeCobayaPyccl` class loads data from a NumPy PKL file containing:\n\n- **`cls`**: Dict of per-spectrum bandpowers, each with `cl` (amplitudes), `Bbl` (bandpower window matrix, nbands × lmax), and `leff` (effective multipoles)\n- **`cov`**: Block-structured covariance matrix (can be full, not just diagonal)\n- **`dndz`**: Per-bin redshift distributions as `(z_array, nz_array)` pairs\n\nThe bandpower window matrix `Bbl` is critical — it applies the binning to theory C_ℓ predictions so they're comparable to measured bandpowers. Our NPZ files already store the full 4D bandpower windows (`bpws` key, shape `(2, nbins, 2, lmax+1)`) from `wksp.get_bandpower_windows()`. The E-mode Bbl used by the likelihood is `bpws[0, :, 0, :]` (shape `nbins × lmax+1`). SACC files don't include window matrices.\n\n## Theory evaluation\n\nTheory C_ℓ computed via CCL (`theory.py`). Tracers: `CMBLensingTracer` for κ, `WeakLensingTracer` for shear (with NLA IA: `A_IA * (1+z)^eta_IA`), `NumberCountsTracer` for galaxy density. Parameters split into cosmological (h, Ω_c, Ω_b, A_s, n_s, m_nu) and nuisance (bias, IA amplitude, n(z) shifts). We already use this for `compute_theory_cls`.\n\n## The gap (updated)\n\nOur pipeline outputs SACC files + NPZ files; the likelihood reads PKL. Remaining pieces:\n\n1. **NPZ→PKL converter** — Our NPZ files have `bpws`, `cls`, `ells`, `knox_var`. The likelihood expects a PKL dict with `cls[specname] = {\"cl\": ..., \"Bbl\": bpws[0,:,0,:], \"leff\": ...}`, `cov`, and `dndz`. This is a data reformatting task, not a computation.\n2. **Covariance format** — SACC has block-diagonal Knox; likelihood can handle full matrix. For joint inference across bins, off-diagonal terms matter.\n3. **Tracer naming** — SACC uses `euclid_lensmc_bin1` etc.; likelihood expects `kappa_g0`, `g0_g0` naming. Trivial mapping.\n\n## Integration path\n\nWrite `npz_to_pkl.py` that reads our NPZ cross-spectrum files + n(z) FITS and assembles the PKL structure. The Bbl extraction is `bpws[0, :, 0, :]` for E-mode κ×γ (already demonstrated in `compute_theory_cls.py` line 84). The converter is the only missing piece — all raw data exists. Downstream work: parameter inference also requires proper covariance (simulations or analytic Gaussian with coupling) beyond Knox diagonal.\n\n## References\n\n- Likelihood: `cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1like_likelihood_pyccl.py`\n- Theory: `cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1like_theory.py`\n- Defaults: `cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1like_defaults.py` (Planck 2018 fiducial)\n- SACC builder: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_combine_cross_spectra.py`",

SACC files lack Bbl — only option is NPZ→PKL converter.

Full covariance would require NaMaster Gaussian (problematic at fsky~0.01) or simulations.\n- No CMB κ transfer function applied — likelihood can handle this via `do_kappa_tf=True` if transfer function data is provided.\n- Only κ×γ spectra — no shear auto-spectra (γ×γ).

The contamination metric X(ℓ) = C^{κS}_ℓ · C^{fS}_ℓ / C^{SS}_ℓ has the same units as the signal C^{Eκ}_ℓ. The bias significance S_bias = sqrt(Σ_ℓ X²/σ²) measures how many σ of bias each systematic contributes, integrating over all ℓ-bins.\n\n**Key finding**: stellar density is the dominant systematic for ACT (4.4σ in bin 5, worse than galactic extinction at 3.7σ). This wasn't apparent from the C^{γS} null tests alone, which flagged galactic extinction as worse — the bias significance weights by the systematic's correlation with *both* tracers simultaneously (C^{κS}/C^{SS}), and stellar density has stronger proportional correlation with CMB κ.\n\n**ACT vs SPT asymmetry**: ACT's larger sky coverage admits more galactic contamination. SPT's deep winter field is almost entirely clean (<1σ across all systematics and bins). The asymmetry is geographic, not instrumental.\n\n**Implications**: S_bias ~ 4.4 against a signal S/N ~ 20 implies ~20% fractional bias in the worst bin — significant for precision cosmology.

For bin 1, the signal S/N is only 5.5σ — so the bias exceeds the statistical uncertainty.\n\n**Questions for the user:**\n1. Should we apply a galactic extinction/stellar density mask cut before parameter inference with ACT?\n2. Should we restrict to SPT for unbiased constraints (SPT is clean, all <1σ)?\n3. Why does metacal show 2× higher bias significance than lensmc for the same systematic? Different shear weights coupling differently to galactic systematics?\n4. The bias significance is a lower bound (C^{SS} noise-biased high) — true bias could be worse.\n\n**Impact:** For a precision measurement, a >1σ systematic bias matters. The combined ACT detection is 20σ, but individual bins have 5-12σ S/N. A 4.4σ bias in a 5.5σ measurement is a 80% fractional bias — not negligible.\n\n**Possible mitigations:**\n- Template deprojection (subtract α·X from the measured C^{Eκ})\n- Galactic mask restriction\n- ℓ-range cuts to avoid contaminated scales\n- Use SPT as primary for parameter inference",

Recommendations: (1) ACT bins 1 and 5 unreliable for parameter inference — exclude or marginalize contamination; (2) SPT is the cleaner dataset for precision cosmology; (3) lensmc less affected than metacal (choose lensmc for ACT); (4) ACT 20σ detection is ~14% inflated by contamination.

After naive subtraction, bin 1 retains only 26% of the expected signal; stellar density accounted for ~70% of the measured amplitude. Bin 5 drops by 25%. The weighted mean amplitude shifts from A_lens = 0.93 to 0.80.\n\nSPT is untouched: the amplitude shifts by less than 0.1σ after deprojection. This cleanly confirms the SPT normalization deficit is intrinsic — it has nothing to do with systematic contamination from the galaxy side.\n\n**Naive subtraction is superseded.** The per-bin bar chart shows naive template subtraction, which *injects template noise* into the chi2 (the X^T C^{-1} X term dominates when templates are noisy). The authoritative values come from Fisher matrix template marginalization: d = A·theory + Σ α_S·X_S, fit jointly. ACT lensmc A_lens = 0.86±0.06, profile chi2/dof = 0.75, PTE = 0.98.

For density × ACT: X^T C^{-1} X = 13,880, catastrophically dominating the chi2 and driving A_lens to −1.2. Marginalization avoids this by absorbing template uncertainty into the Fisher matrix rather than the data vector.\n\n**Earlier skepticism resolved.** The old shear-based concern (\"templates are mostly noise — A barely moves but S/N drops 25%\") was justified for shear, where systematic null tests mostly passed (114/154).

For paper-ready numbers, see `generate_results_table` (LaTeX tables) and `plot_analysis_summary` (one-page figure).\n\n## 1. The central finding\n\nWe measure pseudo-C_ℓ cross-spectra between Euclid (RR2 v2.1, ~30% of DR1 area) and CMB lensing convergence from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G winter field. NaMaster handles mode-coupling from partial sky coverage. The pipeline produces cross-spectra at 20 log-spaced bandpowers over ℓ = 40–3000. Detection significance uses the excess chi2 metric: (χ²−dof)/√(2·dof), zero-centered for noise.\n\n**Galaxy density × CMB-κ is strongly detected.** Joint 6-bin fit against Planck 2018 ΛCDM: ACT A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (18.2σ, χ²/dof = 1.07, PTE = 0.28). SPT A_lens = 0.857 ± 0.050 (22.2σ, χ²/dof = 1.48). Per-bin Knox S/N: 3.1, 6.3, 6.8, 6.7, 11.9, 9.7 (ACT bins 1–6), increasing with redshift as expected from the lensing kernel overlap. 12/12 individual spectra detected above 3σ.\n\n**Shear × CMB-κ is detected.** After fixing the ellipticity sign convention: lensmc × ACT A_lens = 0.88 ± 0.052 (17σ, χ²/dof = 0.92, PTE = 0.72). Metacal × ACT: A_lens = 0.85 ± 0.055 (15σ, χ²/dof = 0.97, PTE = 0.57). Shear × SPT: A_lens ≈ 0.69-0.70 (same normalization deficit seen in density). The ACT shear amplitude is ~12% below unity — potentially consistent with missing shear response correction (RR2 calibration columns are NaN, `rr2-shear-response-correction-74e90e52`) or simply within the expected range given IA and statistical uncertainty.\n\n**Shear sign convention.** The correct mapping from Euclid ellipticities to HEALPix (Q,U) is [-e1, +e2] — Euclid's e1 is along RA (East), while HEALPix Q is along colatitude (South), requiring a π/2 frame rotation (`sign-convention-for-standard-wl-7ebc8d73`). The previous \"non-detection\" (A_lens ≈ 0.06) was caused by this sign being wrong. See `shear-sign-convention-test-b751c2ca` for the resolution.\n\n## 2. Internal consistency\n\nFour independent consistency tests:\n\n**ACT vs SPT** (`plot_act_vs_spt`). 12/12 comparisons pass (6 lensmc + 6 density bins). Median χ²/dof = 0.77, median PTE = 0.75. The two CMB experiments, with independent telescopes, optics, detectors, scanning strategies, and lensing reconstruction pipelines, recover the same cross-correlation signal across all tomographic bins and both shear methods. This is the strongest evidence that the measurement is real and not an artifact of either CMB pipeline.\n\n**lensmc vs metacal** (`plot_method_comparison`). The composite comparison (6 tomographic bins × ACT baseline) shows 0/6 bins passing at 5%, with median χ²/dof = 2.25 and bin-1/bin-2 outliers at χ²/dof = 25/20. The naive chi2 is uninterpretable: both methods share the same galaxies and the same CMB map, so their noise is heavily correlated. The Knox formula for the difference assumes independent noise, overestimating variance where methods agree and underestimating where they don't — the effective degrees of freedom are unknown. Visually, lensmc and metacal spectra overlap across all bins and scales. The per-wildcard comparison (7 bins × 5 CMB experiments) shows 30/35 pass, with all 5 failures in ACT bins where the larger overlap area makes correlated-noise effects more prominent. Proper calibration would require simulations; see `method-chi2-calibration-95cd218e`.\n\n**SPT estimators** (`plot_spt_estimator_comparison`). 36/36 comparisons consistent at 5% (18 per method × 2 shear methods). Median χ²/dof = 0.07, median PTE = 1.00. Four CMB lensing estimators (GMV, TT, PP, MV) yield consistent cross-spectra. Since temperature-based (TT) and polarization-based (PP) estimators have different sensitivity to extragalactic foregrounds (tSZ, CIB, radio sources), this rules out foreground contamination in the CMB lensing reconstruction as a source of bias.\n\n**Catalog vs map** (`plot_catalog_vs_map_comparison`, `plot_catalog_validation_summary`). Composite comparison (6 bins × ACT, per-method) shows max |Δ/σ| = 0.78 (lensmc) and 0.70 (metacal), with per-bin χ²/dof = 0.03–0.06 — the estimators are statistically indistinguishable (the extremely low chi2 reflects the same shared-noise overcount as in the method comparison, here making the test uninformative rather than inflated). Pearson correlation 0.986–1.000 across all 28 per-wildcard comparisons. NmtFieldCatalog computes pseudo-C_ℓ directly from galaxy positions and ellipticities, bypassing pixelization and map-making. Agreement with the map-based pipeline confirms that the map construction step introduces no significant artifacts.\n\n## 3. Null tests\n\nThree classes of null test, probing different potential failure modes:\n\n**Jackknife sign-flip** (`plot_jackknife_null_test`). Random sign (±1) applied to each galaxy's ellipticity, destroying the coherent cosmological signal while preserving noise structure, pixel coverage, and weight maps. 21/24 null spectra consistent with zero (median χ²/dof = 1.09, median PTE = 0.35). Three failures at 5% are consistent with random chance (1.2 expected). No galaxy-side systematics (PSF residuals, selection effects, calibration errors) detected.\n\n**Simulation null** (`plot_sim_null_test`). 11 simulated SPT κ maps (1 Gaussian + 10 Agora from healqest) crossed with real Euclid shear. These simulations have no correlation with the galaxy field by construction. 65/66 spectra consistent with zero (median χ²/dof = 0.98). The one false alarm is expected (~3.3 expected at 5%). The empirical variance ratio (Knox/scatter) = 0.83, confirming Knox is slightly conservative — appropriate for a detection claim.\n\n**Spatial variation** (`plot_spatial_variation`). RR2 footprint split into north (Dec > −31.7°) and south (Dec < −31.7°) patches, each crossed with ACT. 6/6 pass at ℓ > 100 (median χ²/dof = 1.34, PTE = 0.16). Failures at ℓ < 100 are expected — each patch has fsky ~ 0.001, giving < 1 mode per low-ℓ bandpower. SPT excluded from this test because its winter field (Dec < −42°) doesn't overlap the north patch. Decision documented in `knox-unreliable-below-ell-100-868b270f`.\n\n## 4. Systematic contamination\n\nSystematic contamination spans five layers of increasing sophistication. Both tracers are detected, but the systematic profile is radically different: shear is clean (74% of null tests pass), while density is contaminated at every level and requires template marginalization.\n\n**Layer 1: Tracer × systematic null tests** (`compute_systematic_cross_spectrum`, `plot_systematic_null_tests`). Eleven VMPZ-ID templates tested (stellar density, galactic extinction, exposures, SAA, zodiacal light, PSF size, noise, persistence, star brightness, galaxy number density, photo-z quality). Results split sharply by tracer:\n- **Shear**: 114/154 pass (lensmc 57/77, metacal 57/77; median χ²/dof = 1.29). Shear cross-correlations are largely clean of observational systematics.\n- **Density**: 0/77 pass (median χ²/dof = 50.8). Galaxy number counts directly trace observing conditions — more exposures → more detections → higher apparent density. This is expected and makes template marginalization mandatory for density.\n\n**Layer 2: CMB κ × systematic** (`compute_cmbk_systematic_cross_spectrum`). 55 spectra (11 maps × 5 CMB experiments). Galactic extinction contaminates all CMB κ reconstructions (chi2/dof > 3 for all estimators). Stellar density also correlates with CMB κ. This contamination is CMB-estimator-independent — physical (dust biasing the CMB gradient estimator), not an artifact of a specific lensing pipeline.\n\n**Layer 3: Contamination metric** (`plot_contamination_metric`). Following DES×SPT (2203.12440, §A.4): X^f_S(ℓ) = C^{κS}_ℓ · C^{fS}_ℓ / C^{SS}_ℓ measures each systematic's projection into the cross-correlation signal. For shear, all X metrics are sub-percent of signal uncertainty. For density, 3/4 major systematics exceed signal level.\n\n**Layer 4: Bias budget** (`plot_systematic_budget`). S_bias = √(Σ X²/σ²) integrates contamination significance across ℓ-bins. The density and shear budgets are radically different:\n- **Density**: galactic extinction dominates (ACT max 12.6σ, SPT 7.5σ), followed by SAA (6.4σ ACT), stellar density (6.3σ), and exposures (5.7σ). 114/120 entries above 1σ, 69/120 above 3σ.\n- **Shear (lensmc)**: stellar density is the largest contaminant (ACT max 3.8σ), followed by galactic extinction (max 4.4σ ACT). 60/120 above 1σ, 17/120 above 3σ. metacal shows ~2× higher bias than lensmc — different weight maps couple differently to spatially-varying systematics.\n- **ACT/SPT asymmetry**: ACT shows systematically higher contamination, consistent with its larger sky overlap near the galactic plane.\n\n**Layer 5: Template marginalization** (`evaluate_deprojected_likelihood`). The Fisher matrix jointly fits signal amplitude and 10 systematic template amplitudes: d = A·theory + Σ α_S·X_S. Naive template subtraction is catastrophic — for density × ACT, d'^T C^{-1} d' is dominated by template noise (X^T C^{-1} X = 13,880 vs 2·d^T C^{-1} X = 1,802), driving A_lens to −1.2. Marginalization avoids this entirely.\n\n| | Density × ACT | Density × SPT |\n|---|---|---|\n| Raw A_lens | 1.049 ± 0.063 | 0.857 ± 0.050 |\n| Marginalized A_lens | 0.986 ± 0.122 | 0.812 ± 0.122 |\n| Profile χ²/dof | 0.96 | 1.26 |\n| Marginalized PTE | 0.61 | 0.03 |\n| Marginalized S/N | 8.1σ | 6.7σ |\n\nDensity × ACT after marginalization: A_lens = 0.986 ± 0.122, consistent with unity (0.1σ). The raw A_lens = 1.049 was contamination-inflated; the underlying signal agrees perfectly with Planck 2018. The S/N drops from 18σ to 8σ because 10 nuisance parameters absorb degrees of freedom — the price of honest error bars. Dominant templates: PSF size (α = 0.64) and exposures (α = 0.42).\n\nDensity × SPT: marginalized A_lens = 0.812 ± 0.122, still 1.5σ low. Profile χ²/dof = 1.26 (PTE = 0.03) — marginal. The SPT deficit (§6) persists after marginalization.\n\n| | Shear × ACT (lensmc) | Shear × ACT (metacal) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Raw A_lens | 0.880 ± 0.052 | 0.850 ± 0.055 |\n| Marginalized A_lens | 0.824 ± 0.095 | 0.780 ± 0.097 |\n\nShear template marginalization shifts A_lens by ~6–8% downward. Error bars roughly double (from ±0.05 to ±0.10), reflecting the 10 additional nuisance parameters. The marginalized shear amplitudes remain well-detected (8.7σ lensmc, 8.0σ metacal) and the shift is within 1σ of the raw values — shear systematics are subdominant, as expected from the high Layer 1 pass rate.\n\n## 5. Theory comparison\n\nFiducial: Planck 2018 best-fit ΛCDM (decision fiber `fiducial-cosmology-planck-2018-f1a59f23`). Theory C_ℓ computed via CCL with Limber approximation (`compute_theory_cls`). For density, galaxy bias from eDR1like SPV3 with `include_weaklensing=False` — no intrinsic alignment applies.\n\n**Density × ACT.** χ²/dof = 128.4/120, PTE = 0.28. A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063. All six per-bin chi2 tests pass (PTE 0.14–0.74). The density signal is fully consistent with Planck 2018 ΛCDM across all scales and redshifts. This is the cleanest result in the analysis.\n\n**Density × SPT.** χ²/dof = 178.1/120, PTE = 0.0005. A_lens = 0.857 ± 0.050 (14% deficit, 2.9σ). Per-bin structure: bins 1 and 6 fail (PTE = 0.0008, 0.012), bins 2–5 pass (PTE 0.06–0.43). The failure pattern differs from the old shear-based analysis (where bins 1–3 failed and 4–6 passed) — suggesting different systematic signatures in the two tracers. See §6.\n\n**Shear × ACT.** After sign convention fix: lensmc A_lens = 0.88 ± 0.052, χ²/dof = 0.92, PTE = 0.72; metacal A_lens = 0.85 ± 0.055, χ²/dof = 0.97, PTE = 0.57. Both are solid detections with excellent goodness of fit. The amplitude is ~12-15% below unity. The NLA intrinsic alignment model (A_IA = 1.72, η_IA = −0.41, `nla-intrinsic-alignment-cb1dea0b`) suppresses the predicted signal by ~10% (more at low-z), which accounts for some of this deficit. Missing shear response correction (RR2 calibration columns are NaN) may account for the rest.\n\n**Shear × SPT.** Lensmc A_lens = 0.694 ± 0.045, χ²/dof = 2.08, PTE ≈ 0; metacal A_lens = 0.697 ± 0.048, χ²/dof = 1.79, PTE ≈ 0. The deficit relative to ACT (~21%) matches the pattern seen in density (14%). The poor PTE suggests scale-dependent structure in the SPT residuals.\n\nPer-bin shear S/N rises sharply with redshift (lensmc × ACT: 1.5, 0.7, 3.1, 7.1, 12.2, 17.7σ for bins 1–6), as expected from the CMB lensing kernel overlap. χ²/dof degrades with z (1.3 at bin 1 → 17 at bin 6) while density ≈ 1.0 everywhere — pointing to a z-dependent shear calibration issue, likely related to the missing RR2 multiplicative bias correction (`rr2-shear-response-correction-74e90e52`).\n\n## 6. The SPT normalization question\n\nSPT density × κ is 14% low relative to Planck 2018 ΛCDM: A_lens = 0.857 ± 0.050 (2.9σ from unity). This deficit is:\n- **Contamination-independent**: template marginalization changes A_lens by < 0.05 (§4)\n- **Consistent across tracers**: shear × SPT shows ~21% deficit (A_lens ≈ 0.69-0.70 vs 0.85-0.88 for ACT), density × SPT shows ~18% deficit (0.86 vs 1.05 for ACT). Both tracers see lower SPT amplitudes, establishing the deficit as CMB-side\n- **Shape-dependent**: density per-bin analysis shows bins 1 (χ²/dof = 2.3, PTE = 0.0008) and 6 (χ²/dof = 1.8, PTE = 0.012) failing, while bins 2–5 pass. The bin-1 failure is diagnostic: the lowest-redshift bin has the narrowest lensing kernel, making it most sensitive to scale-dependent biases in the κ reconstruction\n\n**ℓ-range robustness test** (`plot_ell_range_robustness`). SPT bins 1–3 amplitude drops from A_lens ≈ 1.5 at ℓ_max ~ 200 to A_lens ≈ 0.7 at full range — high-ℓ bandpowers actively suppress the cross-spectrum. ACT was stable (worst deviation 1.5σ). The pattern — scale-dependent SPT suppression — is consistent with the density bin-1 failure and points to a transfer function issue in the SPT κ reconstruction.\n\n**The ℓ ≈ 84.5 spike** (`spt-ℓ-100-spike-suspicious-ed5a480a`). A single bandpower at ℓ = 84.5 spikes in 5/6 SPT bins with Knox S/N = 3.4–5.1σ. All four SPT estimators agree. The spike amplitude scales with redshift, tracking the lensing kernel — it couples to genuine signal, not additive noise. ACT shows no corresponding feature.\n\nN0/N1 bias subtraction affects only auto-spectra (C^{κκ}), not cross-spectra (C^{κf}). The deficit must originate in the response function normalization or mean-field residuals. The simulation null test (65/66 pass) confirms no spurious correlation; the issue is the amplitude and shape of the real signal. Leading hypotheses: (1) SPT κ transfer function — scale-dependent normalization bias; (2) SPT mask mode-coupling at fsky ≈ 0.04; (3) SPT lmin filtering distorting cross-spectrum at low output multipoles. See `spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41`.\n\n## 7. Covariance and statistical framework\n\nKnox analytic covariance is primary for all chi2/PTE computations (`covariance-methodology-b17f19da`). Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes with fsky_eff from Hivon (2002). Diagonal — no bandpower correlations. Validated by simulation null test: empirical variance ratio 0.83 (Knox slightly conservative).\n\nNaMaster Gaussian covariance (iNKA) agrees with Knox within ~25% (median NaMaster/Knox = 1.04 for density, 1.26 for shear — validated in `covariance-validation-namaster-4b3c85a4`). An earlier 31× apparent overestimate was an interleaved diagonal extraction bug, now fixed. NaMaster is used for plot error bars (captures mode coupling), but has a coupling matrix artifact at the last bandpower (ℓ≈2700) where variance drops ~1000× below Knox, so Knox remains primary for all quantitative inference.\n\nThe fiducial likelihood PKL file packages block-diagonal Knox covariance (one block per tomographic bin), bandpower windows (Bbl), and data vectors. This is the same Knox framework used throughout — `build_likelihood_input.py` constructs `cov_all` from `knox_var` arrays, not from NaMaster.\n\n## 8. Data products\n\n**SACC files** (`validate_sacc`). Combined data product containing tracers (NZTracer for shear, MiscTracer for CMB κ), n(z) curves (6 bins from RR2_v2_Nz_WL_C2020_sel_pv), data vectors (560 points per CMB: 14 spectra × 40 bandpowers), and covariance matrices.\n\n**PKL files** (`build_likelihood_input`). NPZ→PKL bridge for the eDR1like likelihood. Includes bandpower window functions (Bbl), data vectors, covariance, and tracer information. Four files: 2 methods × 2 CMB baselines.\n\n**LaTeX results tables** (`generate_results_table`). Three tables: detection & theory (Table 1), per-bin amplitudes (Table 2), validation summary (Table 3). All numbers traceable to evidence.json files.\n\n## 9. Summary of key numbers\n\n### Density × CMB-κ (the detection)\n\n| Quantity | ACT | SPT |\n|---|---|---|\n| Joint S/N (excess χ²) | 18.2σ | 22.2σ |\n| A_lens (Planck 2018) | 1.049 ± 0.063 | 0.857 ± 0.050 |\n| χ²/dof | 1.07 (PTE 0.28) | 1.48 (PTE ≈ 0) |\n| Per-bin Knox S/N | 3.1–11.9 | 5.1–15.9 |\n| Consistency (ACT vs SPT) | 6/6 pass (med PTE 0.49) | |\n\n### Shear × CMB-κ (detected after sign fix)\n\n| Quantity | ACT (lensmc) | ACT (metacal) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Joint A_lens | 0.88 ± 0.052 | 0.85 ± 0.055 |\n| Joint S/N (excess χ²) | 17.3σ | 14.8σ |\n| χ²/dof (PTE) | 0.92 (0.72) | 0.97 (0.57) |\n| SPT lensmc A_lens | 0.694 ± 0.045 | |\n| SPT metacal A_lens | 0.697 ± 0.048 | |\n\n### Validation\n\n| Test | Result |\n|---|---|\n| ACT vs SPT (lensmc + density) | 12/12 pass (median PTE 0.75) |\n| lensmc vs metacal | 0/6 pass (χ² uncalibrated — shared noise) |\n| Catalog vs map | max |Δ/σ| < 0.8, r = 0.994 (n=28) |\n| Jackknife null | 21/24 pass (median χ²/dof 1.09) |\n| Sim null | 65/66 pass (median χ²/dof 0.98) |\n| Systematic null (shear) | 114/154 pass (74%) |\n| Systematic null (density) | 0/77 pass (expected) |\n\n## 10. Galaxy density × CMB lensing (δκ)\n\nThe same five-layer methodology extends to galaxy number counts (`galaxy-density-cmb-lensing-δκ-a755afc3`). Overdensity maps built from the GC catalog (1.1–1.5M galaxies per bin, nside=2048) are crossed with the same ACT and SPT κ maps.\n\n**Detection.** 10/12 cross-spectra detected above 5σ, 12/12 above 3σ (6 bins × 2 CMB). ACT Knox S/N: 3.1, 6.3, 6.8, 6.7, 11.9, 9.7 (bins 1–6). SPT: 5.1, 10.7, 10.4, 4.3, 7.9, 15.9. S/N increases with redshift as expected from the lensing kernel overlap, though the pattern is non-monotonic (ACT bin 1 and SPT bin 4 are the weakest, reflecting the narrow low-z kernel and smaller SPT overlap respectively). No intrinsic alignment — density theory uses Planck 2018 + SPV3 galaxy bias with `include_weaklensing=False`.\n\n**Theory comparison.** ACT A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (χ²/dof = 1.07, PTE = 0.28) — perfect agreement with Planck 2018, no IA ambiguity. SPT A_lens = 0.857 ± 0.050 (χ²/dof = 1.48, PTE = 0.0005) — 14% deficit (2.9σ). The SPT deficit appears in both γκ (~21% for shear) and δκ (14% for density), confirming it originates from the CMB κ side, not the galaxy tracer.\n\n**Systematic contamination is far worse than shear.** All 77/77 density × systematic null tests fail (median χ²/dof = 50.8, all PTE = 0). Number counts directly trace observing conditions — more exposures → more detections → higher apparent density.\n\nContamination metric: 3/4 systematics exceed signal level. X/signal ratios: stellar density 1.4–2.3, galactic extinction 1.4–2.8, exposures 1.1–2.2. Only zodiacal light is clean (doesn't correlate with CMB κ). Raw δκ A_lens values are biased upward by systematic contamination.\n\n**Template marginalization essential.** Fisher matrix fit (d = A·theory + Σ α_S·X_S) with 10 active templates yields ACT A_lens = 0.986 ± 0.122 (8.1σ, χ²/dof = 0.96, PTE = 0.61) and SPT A_lens = 0.812 ± 0.122 (6.7σ, χ²/dof = 1.26, PTE = 0.03). Naive template subtraction is catastrophic (ACT A_lens → −1.2) because template noise (X^T C^{-1} X = 13,880) dominates. Dominant templates: PSF size (α = 0.64) and exposures (α = 0.42) for ACT; PSF size (α = −2.6) for SPT.\n\n**δκ as an independent SPT probe.** Both γκ and δκ show SPT deficits: density A_lens = 0.857 raw (0.812 marginalized), shear A_lens ≈ 0.69-0.70 (vs 0.85-0.88 for ACT). That two different galaxy tracers — shear (spin-2, IA-affected) and density (spin-0, bias-affected) — both show lower SPT amplitudes relative to ACT establishes the deficit as a property of the SPT CMB κ reconstruction, not a galaxy-side effect.\n\n## 11. Open items\n\n- **Shear amplitude ~12% low** — lensmc×ACT A_lens = 0.88, metacal×ACT = 0.85. Possible explanations: missing shear response correction (RR2 calibration columns are NaN, `rr2-shear-response-correction-74e90e52`), IA model absorbing some signal (~10%), or statistical fluctuation (1.5-2σ from unity). Within the expected range for uncalibrated shear. Template marginalization gives 0.824±0.095 / 0.780±0.097 — the shift is small, confirming shear systematics are subdominant.\n- **SPT normalization deficit** — density A_lens = 0.857 (14% low, 2.9σ). Both γκ and δκ see it → CMB-side origin. Not addressable without SPT team input. See `spt-normalization-deficit-2cbccf68`.\n- **Curl mode null test** — blocked on data. ACT provides only baseline ILC κ; SPT has no curl product.\n- **Mass maps** — SKS/SKSP maps at v1.4 path, not v2.1. Investigated in `mass-maps-at-v1-4-path-not-v2-1-fdc14589`.\n- **Blinding strategy** — unresolved. See `cmbx-3x2pt-blinding-strategy-d2469de7`.\n\n## Provenance\n\nThis synthesis was compiled from 24 tapestry-tagged fibers with evidence files at `results/claims/{specName}/evidence.json`. Full pipeline rebuilt 2026-02-25 after resolving the Euclid position-angle sign convention (`pol_conv=\"EUCLID\"` → [-e1, +e2]; see `shear-sign-convention-test-b751c2ca`). Deprojected likelihood rebuilt with post-fix shear data (15 jobs). Tapestry nodes: 24 active (5 spine + 19 interior), organized into 6 regions. Aggregate evidence rules updated 2026-02-16 to include density (method=\"density\") alongside shear methods. Per-bin chi2 values use shape tests at best-fit amplitude (ν = 19), isolating spectral shape from amplitude deficit; joint fits use the full covariance (ν = 119 for IA, ν = 115 for marginalized). A_lens = data / (Planck 2018 ΛCDM + NLA IA) for γκ; A_lens = data / (Planck 2018 ΛCDM + galaxy bias) for δκ. A_IA is a fixed nuisance parameter for γκ (see `a-lens-naming-fitted-amplitude-c5d1c543`). Theory prediction uses CCL with Halofit nonlinear P(k). Every number in this document traces back to a specific evidence.json field, which in turn traces to a Snakemake rule output.",

      "body": "Three independent lines of evidence characterize the SPT deficit:\n\n1. **Per-bin shape tests** (from `plot_theory_residual_analysis`): SPT bins 1–3 FAIL the shape test at best-fit A (chi2/dof 1.7–2.7) — the ℓ-shape of the measured cross-spectrum doesn't match theory even after fitting the overall amplitude. Bins 4–6 PASS shape, showing a pure amplitude deficit. ACT passes shape in all bins.\n\n2. **ℓ-range robustness** (from `plot_ell_range_robustness`): Progressive ℓ_max cuts reveal that SPT amplitude drops monotonically as high-ℓ bandpowers are added. At ℓ_max ~ 200, A ≈ 1.5 (consistent with theory within errors). At full range, A ≈ 0.7. The data at ℓ > 500 is actively suppressing the cross-correlation amplitude relative to theory. ACT does not show this trend (max deviation 1.5σ).\n\n3. **ACT/SPT amplitude ratio**: ~1.2 across bins, consistent with a CMB-side normalization offset rather than galaxy-side systematics.\n\n## Hypothesis ranking\n\nThe scale-dependent suppression at high ℓ, specific to SPT but not ACT, narrows the hypotheses:\n\n- **SPT κ transfer function** (FAVORED): The SPT lensing reconstruction has an effective response function that may not be perfectly normalized at high ℓ. If our theory doesn't account for the ℓ-dependent reconstruction efficiency, the cross-spectrum amplitude would appear suppressed at high ℓ.\n\n- **Missing baryonic feedback** (DISFAVORED for this effect): Baryonic effects would suppress both ACT and SPT cross-spectra at high ℓ. The observed effect is SPT-specific. However, baryonic feedback could contribute a ~3–5% common suppression not detectable in this test.\n\n- **SPT noise bias leakage** (POSSIBLE): Higher-order noise biases (N3/2, trispectrum) can leak into cross-correlations. These grow at high ℓ. However, simulation null tests (66 SPT sims × Euclid galaxies) show no spurious correlations, constraining this contribution.\n\nThe resolution requires the SPT team to provide the ℓ-dependent normalization of their lensing reconstruction, or to compare with simulation-based transfer function calibration.",
      "outcome": "Per-bin analysis reveals two distinct regimes in the SPT deficit. Bins 1-3 (low-z): shape FAILS (chi2_shape/dof 1.7-2.7, PTE<0.03). Bins 4-6 (high-z): shape passes, amplitude deficit only (A_hat 0.72-0.99). ACT passes shape in ALL bins. The ℓ-range robustness test (iteration 31) confirms this is SCALE-DEPENDENT: SPT bins 1-3 show A_hat dropping from ~1.5 at ℓ_max~200 to ~0.7 at full range — high-ℓ bandpowers actively suppress the amplitude. ACT is stable (worst deviation 1.5σ). This rules out a uniform calibration offset and points to SPT κ transfer function effects at high ℓ, not missing baryonic feedback (which would affect both experiments). Requires SPT team investigation of response function normalization.",

Matter power spectrum via CCL's Boltzmann solver (CLASS), Limber integration for angular power spectra.\n\n**NLA intrinsic alignment** — A_IA = 1.72, η_IA = −0.41 (eDR1like defaults, consistent with KiDS/DES). Applied via CCL's `WeakLensingTracer(ia_bias=...)` which handles C₁ρ_cr Ω_m / D(z) internally. Suppresses C^{Eκ} by 4–36% depending on redshift (strongest at low-z). See `nla-intrinsic-alignment-cb1dea0b`.\n\n## What's excluded\n\n### Baryonic feedback\n\nAvailable in eDR1like via CAMB backend with HMCode Mead2020 defaults (A_baryon=3.13, eta_baryon=0.603, logT_AGN=7.8). Not available through CCL backend, which is what `compute_theory_cls.py` uses. Typical effect: suppresses P(k) by 5–15% at k > 1 h/Mpc (ℓ > 1000 for our redshifts). Would increase A_hat by ~3–5%. Impact on profile chi2: minor (ℓ-dependent shape change within existing error bars).\n\n### Multiplicative shear calibration (m)\n\nNot implemented in eDR1like at all — absent from both `theory.py` and `likelihood_pyccl.py`. For comparison, DES shear analyses (`shearXlensing/tracer_info_des_blue.yml`) include per-bin m-bias with uncertainties. Euclid target: |m| < 0.02. Effect: shifts observed shear by factor (1+m), so A_hat_corrected = A_hat / (1+m). For m = −0.02: correction is ~2%. Subdominant to σ_A ≈ 0.06 (0.3σ shift).\n\n### Photometric redshift errors\n\neDR1like supports n(z) shifts via `wz_i` (width) and `Dz_i` (mean shift) parameters, disabled by default. These are nuisance parameters for MCMC fitting. At our stage (fixed fiducial cosmology, amplitude-only fits), n(z) errors are absorbed into the effective A_hat.\n\n## Combined impact estimate\n\nThe missing effects are cumulative but partially degenerate: baryonic feedback (~3–5%), m-bias (~2%), n(z) shifts (~1–3%) sum to ~6–10% correction. ACT marginalized Â(IA) = 0.86 ± 0.06 is 2.3σ from unity. Including all missing effects could bring this to ~0.91–0.95 (within 1σ) — fully consistent with theory. For SPT (Â = 0.75, 5σ deficit), missing effects account for at most ~10% of the 24% deficit.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe current model (ΛCDM + NLA IA) is adequate for the validation/detection stage. All missing effects are within our statistical uncertainty. Parameter inference with the eDR1like likelihood would need: (a) switch to CAMB backend for baryonic feedback, (b) add m-bias marginalization (code contribution to eDR1like), (c) enable n(z) shift priors.",

Not included because CCL backend lacks HMCode; would need backend switch. (2) Multiplicative shear calibration (m) — not implemented in eDR1like. Typical m~-0.02±0.02 shifts A_hat by 1/(1+m)~1.02.

Starting from ℓ_max ≈ 105 (5 bandpowers minimum), each step adds one more bandpower until the full range (ℓ ≈ 2700).\n\n**ACT is scale-stable.** Worst deviation from the full-range A_lens is 1.5σ (bin 3). Bins 4-6 are rock-solid (< 1σ). The ACT measurement is robust to ℓ-range selection.\n\n**SPT shows scale-dependent deficit.** Bins 1-3 start at A_lens ≈ 1.5 with only low-ℓ bandpowers and drop to A_lens ≈ 0.7 as high-ℓ data is added. The deficit is not a uniform calibration offset — high-ℓ bandpowers actively suppress the amplitude. Worst case: bin 2, max deviation 2.7σ, A_lens range 0.74-2.55. Bins 4-6 are more stable (deviations 1.3-1.9σ) but still trend downward.\n\n**Per-estimator breakdown sharpens the picture.** Running the same test separately for SPT TT, PP, and MV reveals the scale dependence is primarily temperature-driven. PP (polarization-only) is the most scale-stable (worst 1.82σ vs 2.4-2.7σ for TT/GMV/MV) and gives systematically higher full-range A_lens (0.83-1.41 vs 0.08-0.85 for TT). TT bin 1 is catastrophic (A_lens = 0.08); PP bin 1 gives A_lens = 1.41. Combined estimators (GMV, MV) inherit TT's instability.\n\nThis constrains the deficit's origin (full characterization in [SPT deficit](.felt/spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41.md)). Three hypotheses, refined by the per-estimator test:\n\n1. **SPT κ_TT normalization/filtering** — temperature-specific normalization residual in the Wiener-filtered κ map. PP's stability and higher amplitudes strongly favor a T-side origin. Foreground leakage into κ_TT at low ℓ is a candidate mechanism. Favored: explains both ACT/SPT asymmetry and TT/PP asymmetry.\n\n2. **Higher-order noise bias leakage** — N3/2 and trispectrum terms that formally cancel in cross-correlation but may leak at high ℓ. Also CMB-side, SPT-specific. Partially consistent — but would not explain the strong TT/PP asymmetry unless N0_TT >> N0_PP.\n\n3. **Baryonic feedback** — suppresses small-scale matter power (ℓ > 500-1000). Disfavored: would affect both experiments and both estimators equally.",

      "body": "Shape the research tapestry into something navigable. The previous ralph spec (`research-tapestry-inspectable`) built this tapestry — 31 nodes, 175 plots, 31 iterations of evidence gathering. This spec shapes it: compress, narrate, make it a map someone can walk into and orient themselves.\n\nWe're not making an argument or converging on a conclusion. The analysis is growing and being refined. The tapestry should reflect that — a living map of where the analysis is, what it sees, and where to look next. The same tapestry continues to evolve; we're reshaping how it presents itself.\n\n## Desired State\n\nThe tapestry has a clear entry point and a natural flow. A person arriving cold can start on the left, move through it, and emerge understanding the state of the analysis — what's been measured, what's been tested, what's open, what needs attention.\n\nCurrent regions of the map (suggestive, not fixed — add, combine, split as the analysis grows):\n\n1. The data — sky coverage, redshift bins, what we're crossing\n2. The signal — what we see, how strong\n3. Consistency — do independent measurements agree?\n4. Null tests — what should be zero, is it?\n5. Contamination — what leaks in, how much, from where\n6. Cleaning — how we handle what leaks in\n7. Theory — how measurements compare to predictions\n8. Open questions — what's unresolved, what needs further work\n\nThese aren't conclusions. They're *regions* of the map. The tapestry is a tool for understanding, not a proof. It should inform the next iteration of improvement — a tapestry that can continue to knit itself.\n\n### Working discipline\n\n**Read plots sparingly.** Never read more than 5 images in a single session. Plot review is expensive — each image consumes context that could go toward actual work. When reviewing a node, read its 1–2 key plots and move on. A session that reads a dozen images accomplishes nothing else.\n\n### Node discipline\n\nEach tapestry node has:\n\n- **1–5 plots** that efficiently convey its point. 2–3 is ideal. A plot earns its place by saying something no other plot says. If two plots make the same point, merge or cut.\n- **A body** that reads as prose — a few sentences or a few paragraphs, whatever the scene needs. Not diagnostic output, not a methods section. A reader encountering this node should understand what it shows and why it matters.\n- **An outcome** that summarizes the current state. One sentence is often enough.\n- **Evidence** at `results/claims/{specName}/evidence.json` with the key numbers.\n\nNot every figure needs to be composite. A standalone plot that makes a clear point is fine. The goal is communication efficiency, not mechanical compression.\n\n### Visualization quality\n\nPrefer plots that show the spectra over summary statistics that compress them away. A heatmap of chi2/PTE values is a pass/fail table — you can't tell from it whether the analysis is sound. Better:\n\n- **Cross-spectral correlation coefficients** — show spectral agreement, not a single number\n- **Chi-square distributions** — show where the fit works and where it doesn't\n- **Residual spectra** — show what's left after subtraction or fitting\n\nA reader should be able to see the data, not just summaries of it. Bar charts and coarse heatmaps are acceptable as quick references in a summary panel, but the node's main figure should carry spectral information.\n\n### Gradual reshaping\n\nThis is improvement, not replacement. The current 31 nodes are raw material. Each iteration:\n\n- **Merge** nodes that cover the same region of the map\n- **Split** nodes that cover too much ground\n- **Rework** bodies from diagnostic summaries into narrative prose\n- **Create** composite figures that compress per-wildcard galleries\n- **Adjust** `tapestry:` tags and felt dependencies to reflect the evolving structure\n\nOld fibers that lose their `tapestry:` tag remain as documentation — the detailed record. New or reworked fibers carry the narrative forward. When plots become obsolete (superseded by a composite, or removed from a node), delete them from `results/claims/{specName}/` so they don't keep showing up in the tapestry.\n\n### Iteration rhythm\n\nEach iteration runs until the usage limit resets at 3 AM Paris time — that's the natural stopping point. Within each session, make as much progress as taste and judgment allow. There's no fixed \"done\" threshold for the tapestry itself; it's an evolving artifact. Progress means: fewer redundant plots, clearer prose, better flow, more natural entry points.\n\n## Context\n\n### The story so far\n\nThe findings synthesis (`felt show findings-synthesis-euclid-cmb-03354e57`) walks the current state. It's the reference for *what's been found*. The tapestry is how it's *shown and navigated*.\n\nKey state: 20σ/21σ raw detection → 15σ/14σ after marginalization. Four consistency tests pass. Three null tests pass. Stellar density contaminates ACT (boosts signal). Template marginalization (Fisher) corrects properly. SPT shows 24% normalization deficit — scale-dependent, intrinsic, open question. After marginalization: ACT consistent with ΛCDM, SPT still low.\n\n**Narrative framing**: Detection-centered. The main results are detection significance, ΛCDM consistency, and systematic characterization.\n\n- **A_IA is a nuisance parameter.** NLA IA (A_IA=1.72, η=-0.41) is a fixed ingredient in the theory prediction from the Euclid pipeline. It decreases the predicted amplitude. It is not a finding and should not be framed as one.\n- **A_lens is the measurement.** The fitted amplitude A_lens = data / theory, where theory = Planck 2018 ΛCDM + NLA IA. A_lens = 1 means agreement with standard predictions. This is a lensing amplitude, not an IA amplitude — IA is already absorbed into the prediction.\n- **Blinding.** We are not technically in the 3x2pt pipeline group, so current fixed-cosmology comparisons are fine internally. But don't share broadly, and don't push further on fitting (no Ω_m, S_8 constraints). The TR1 analysis plan (Stage B) allows comparing to synthetic at reference cosmology; amplitude fitting is at the boundary and should stay internal.\n\n### Consolidated doc fibers\n\nThese doc fibers consolidate scattered iteration notes into useful references. They reflect the analysis as of iteration 31 — the analysis continues to evolve, so treat them as a starting point for prose, not a fixed source of truth:\n\n- `systematic-contamination-five-f509e962` — the five-layer contamination methodology (null tests → CMB-side → metric → budget → marginalization). This is the backbone for the contamination and cleaning regions of the tapestry.\n- `spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41` — SPT 24% deficit: bin-level structure, scale dependence, hypothesis ranking. The open-questions region.\n- `namaster-technical-patterns-60d42621` — sign conventions, masking, I/O patterns. Technical foundations.\n- `snakemake-workflow-discipline-88f4f4f8` — DAG discipline, ancient() traps. Operational reference for the loop itself.\n\n### Current tapestry\n\n~22 tapestry nodes, ~31 PNGs. Infrastructure nodes (compute_*, combine_*, build_*, validate_*) removed from tapestry in iteration 2 — they remain as documentation fibers. `plot_field_overview` added in iteration 6 as the \"data\" entry point (Wiener-filtered maps on the sky). NLA IA separated into its own doc fiber (`nla-intrinsic-alignment-theory-57e37bd1`) — not a tapestry node, but a referenced dependency from theory_comparison and theory_residual.\n\n**All plots carry spectral content** — heatmaps replaced in iterations 3-5. No pass/fail heatmaps remain as primary figures (budget heatmap acceptable as integrated summary).\n\n**Narrative flow verified** (iteration 10): 22 fiber bodies read in dependency order. Story flows naturally from data → signal → consistency → null tests → contamination → cleaning → theory → summary. Cross-links between fibers are comprehensive. Fiber titles rewritten to communicate findings (15 titles updated).\n\n**Next shaping priorities**:\n- Wiener filter diagnostic: verify W(ℓ) makes sense by plotting signal vs signal+noise power spectra for ACT/SPT κ (filed as question fiber, low priority)\n- The \"open questions\" region (SPT deficit, theory completeness) is implicitly present via theory_residual → ℓ-range_robustness → spt-deficit-characterization doc fiber, but has no dedicated visual space. Consider whether to create an explicit node or leave distributed.\n- Further body tightening: some fibers still repeat Knox covariance methodology that belongs in compare_nz. Acceptable for self-containment but could be trimmed further.\n\nCoverage check: `grep -rh 'tapestry:' .felt/*.md | grep -oP 'tapestry:\\S+' | sort -u`\nPlot inventory: `for d in results/claims/*/; do echo \"$(ls \"$d\"/*.png 2>/dev/null | wc -l) $(basename \"$d\")\"; done | sort -rn`\n\n### Relationship to the previous spec\n\n`research-tapestry-inspectable-fef1295c` built this tapestry — made every rule inspectable, wired the DAG, populated evidence. That spec remains open (the tapestry continues to grow). This spec shapes the same tapestry: how it presents, how it reads, how a person navigates it. Same object, different concern.\n\n### Files and patterns\n\n- **Snakefile**: `workflow/Snakefile` + `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`\n- **Plot scripts**: `workflow/scripts/plot_*.py`\n- **Evidence aggregation**: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_aggregate_evidence.py`\n- **Evidence directory**: `results/claims/{specName}/`\n- **Fiber files**: `.felt/*.md`\n\n### Creating composite figures\n\nNew composite figures should:\n\n1. Be snakemake localrules (just plotting)\n2. Read from existing NPZ/evidence outputs (don't recompute)\n3. Output to `results/claims/{specName}/` with evidence.json + PNGs\n4. Have corresponding felt fibers with `tapestry:{specName}` tags\n\nFollow the pattern of existing plot rules — scripts read config, load upstream outputs, produce PNG + evidence.json. When reworking an existing node rather than creating a new one, modify the existing script and rule in place.\n\n## Skills\n\n- `/tapestry` — fiber ↔ evidence ↔ plot conventions\n- `/snakemake` — adding localrules, execution\n- `/data-visualization` — composite figure design\n- `/felt` — fiber management, tag editing, dependency wiring\n- `/implementing-code` — script development\n\n## Evidence\n\nCheck progress:\n\n- Plot inventory: `for d in results/claims/*/; do echo \"$(ls \"$d\"/*.png 2>/dev/null | wc -l) $(basename \"$d\")\"; done | sort -rn`\n- Total plots: `ls results/claims/*/*.png 2>/dev/null | wc -l`\n- Narrative test: read fiber bodies in dependency order — does the story flow?",

The deficit has three layers of structure that point to a CMB-side origin.\n\n**Layer 1: bin-level.** Shape fails at low redshift (bins 1-3, chi2_shape/dof = 1.7-2.7) but passes at high redshift (bins 4-6, chi2_shape/dof = 1.2-1.6). At high-z the deficit is amplitude-only — the spectral shape is correct but the overall normalization is low. At low-z the shape itself is wrong, likely from SPT's ℓ_min ≈ 500 filtering distorting cross-spectrum bandpowers at low ℓ.\n\n**Layer 2: ℓ-range dependence.** Progressive ℓ_max cuts show A_lens dropping from ~1.5 at ℓ_max ≈ 200 to ~0.7 at full range. The worst case is bin 2 (2.7σ deviation, A range 0.74-2.55). ACT is stable (worst 1.5σ). This rules out a uniform calibration offset and disfavors baryonic feedback (which would affect both experiments).\n\n**Layer 3: the ℓ=84.5 spike.** A single bandpower at ℓ=84.5 spikes in 5/6 SPT bins (Knox S/N = 3.4-5.1σ, 3.8-5.4× neighbor average). All four SPT estimators (GMV/TT/PP/MV) agree within ~20%. Both shear methods agree. B-modes are clean. The spike amplitude scales with redshift bin (3e-8 to 1.1e-7), tracking the lensing kernel — it's coupling to genuine signal, not additive noise. This single bandpower is likely the dominant driver of the ℓ-range amplitude inflation at low ℓ_max, and its inclusion at full range suppresses the fitted A_lens.\n\n**Hypotheses (ranked):**\n1. SPT κ transfer function — scale-dependent normalization bias in the lensing reconstruction pipeline. The ℓ=84.5 feature suggests a specific angular scale where the reconstruction is miscalibrated.\n2. SPT mask mode-coupling — the compact SPT winter field (fsky ≈ 0.04) creates stronger mode-coupling at low ℓ than ACT's broader footprint (fsky ≈ 0.25). A single ℓ bin could absorb leaked power.\n3. SPT lmin filtering — the reconstruction pipeline applies ℓ_min ≈ 500 to temperature maps, which could distort the cross-spectrum at low output multipoles through non-trivial mode-mixing.\n\n**Ruled out:** systematic contamination (SPT is clean in bias budget), foreground bias (all estimators agree), shear method dependence (lensmc ≈ metacal), baryonic feedback (would affect both experiments equally).",

These are not fitted — they enter the theory prediction the same way Planck cosmological parameters do. The model is passed to `CCL.WeakLensingTracer` with `use_A_ia=True`, which handles the C₁ρ_cr Ω_m/D(z) normalization internally.\n\n**Effect on the cross-spectrum**: IA suppresses the signal by 36% in bin 1 (z ≈ 0.3, where lensing and source redshifts overlap most) down to 4% in bin 6 (z ≈ 1.5, where the GI geometry is less favorable).

Adding standard IA brings theory and ACT data into agreement ([theory comparison](.felt/theory-comparison-data-d5cc9678.md)).\n\n**What IA is not**: It's not a free parameter we tune to match the data. It's not a finding of this analysis. The theory comparison fiber shows the vanilla-to-NLA shift as a diagnostic — the question is whether standard ingredients are sufficient, not whether IA \"resolves\" anything.\n\n**Implementation**: `compute_theory_cls.py` outputs both `cl_theory_bin{N}` (vanilla) and `cl_ia_theory_bin{N}` (NLA) in the same NPZ.

The scientist sees it, responds, and the loop tightens.\n\nThe goal isn't narrative polish. It's advancing the analysis itself — closing open questions, running new checks, extending coverage — and keeping the tapestry honest about what was found.\n\n## Desired State\n\nThe analysis improves. Each iteration: survey ALL open fibers (`felt ls` — not just `felt downstream`, which only shows fibers linked to this spec), close what can be closed through work, and update the tapestry to reflect reality.\n\nWhen open items run out, curiosity drives the next question. The project scope (`docs/spt_euclid_proposal.md`) and the reference papers define what a complete analysis looks like. Read them. Find the gaps between what we've done and what they did. File new fibers for what's missing. The tapestry grows by discovering what it lacks.\n\nAfter new work, update affected tapestry nodes. Keep the principles: finding-oriented titles, spectral plots, prose bodies, cross-links. Grow the tapestry only when new work warrants it.\n\n### Code health\n\nThe codebase grew through 30+ iterations. When the open-fiber queue is light or at the end of an iteration, run a code-simplification pass using subagents:\n\n1. **Launch** several Explore subagents in parallel to audit different parts of the codebase — scripts, config, Snakefile rules, shared utilities. Each checks for: duplicated logic, hardcoded values that belong in config, copy-pasted functions, inconsistent patterns.\n2. **Synthesize** their findings into a concrete list of refactors.\n3. **Implement** the changes: extract shared utilities, consolidate config, DRY up repeated patterns.\n\nPrinciples:\n- **Single source of truth**: Parameter values live in `cmbx/files/config_config.yaml`, not hardcoded in scripts. Cosmological parameters, ℓ ranges, bin counts, file paths — one place.\n- **DRY**: If three scripts compute Knox covariance the same way, that's one function in a shared module.\n- **Maintainable structure**: The pipeline needs to survive handoff to collaborators and DR1.\n\nThis is not optional background work — when no analysis fibers are immediately actionable, code simplification IS the work.\n\n### Done\n\nRun until all open fibers and avenues have been addressed. Progress = open fibers closed, analysis extended, tapestry honest about the current state.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- **A_lens is the measurement.** A_lens = data / (Planck 2018 ΛCDM + NLA IA). A_lens = 1 means agreement. A_IA is a fixed nuisance parameter, not a result.\n- **Blinding.** Fixed-cosmology A_lens fitting is fine internally. No Ω_m, S_8 fits. Don't share broadly.\n- **Plots carry data.** Spectra, residuals, correlation coefficients — not summary heatmaps. The reader sees the data.\n- **Read plots sparingly.** Max 5 images per session.\n- **Node discipline.** 1–5 plots per node. Prose bodies. Evidence at `results/claims/{specName}/evidence.json`.\n- **Cross-links.** Use markdown links to `.felt/` files so they render as clickable in the dashboard: `[field overview](.felt/the-sky-act-spt-and-euclid-on-706364a6.md)`. Not backtick `tapestry:` references.\n- **Trust the DAG.** Never suppress reruns. Recomputation is cheap, stale results are not.\n\n## Context\n\n### Project scope and references\n\n- **Proposal**: `docs/spt_euclid_proposal.md` — full 3×2pt scope (δκ, γκ, κκ), deliverables, team\n- **MoU fiber**: `spt-euclid-mou-collaboration-6de6bc54`\n- **DES×SPT×Planck methods**: `docs/papers/2203.12439_des_spt_planck_methods/main.tex`\n- **DES×SPT×Planck correlations**: `docs/papers/2203.12440_des_spt_planck_correlations/main.tex`\n- **DES×SPT×Planck constraints**: `docs/papers/2206.10824_des_spt_planck_constraints/main.tex`\n- **ACT×DES shear**: `docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex`\n\n### Current analysis state\n\n`felt show findings-synthesis-euclid-cmb-03354e57` — the comprehensive narrative.\n\nKey numbers: 20σ/21σ raw → 15σ/14σ marginalized.

The shear side gets `apodize(weight > 0, 0.15, \"C2\") * weight` — the same taper applied to the binary footprint, then multiplied by the galaxy weight map. The weight map encodes inverse shape-noise variance per pixel, so the effective mask is spatially varying even within the apodized boundary.\n\nThese masks define the effective sky fraction that enters the Knox covariance: `fsky_eff = ⟨w₁w₂⟩² / ⟨w₁²w₂²⟩` (Hivon 2002). The C2 apodization with 0.15 rad (~8.6°) scale reduces fsky relative to the raw footprint but suppresses mode-coupling from sharp mask boundaries.\n\nThe figure shows raw vs apodized for all three masks: ACT, SPT, and shear weights.

SPT's winter field mask has sharp boundaries at small fsky (~0.27% in overlap). Apodization mode-coupling at ℓ≈100 could inject power at this specific angular scale.\n\nTests:\n- Vary SPT mask apodization width (current: 0.15 deg C2). Try 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.30. Does the spike move or change amplitude?\n- Compare SPT mask power spectrum to ACT mask power spectrum — look for excess power at ℓ≈100 in the SPT mask\n- Check the NaMaster coupling matrix at this bandpower — is there anomalous mode-mixing?\n- Compute the cross-spectrum with NO apodization (binary mask only) — does the spike persist?\n\nIf the spike is apodization-induced, it should respond to apodization width changes.

Config flag so map-based remains available as fallback.\n\n## Rationale\n\nCatalog-based avoids pixelization effects and map-making entirely — one fewer step between galaxies and spectra. Validation showed agreement with map-based at correlation 0.986–1.000 across 28 shear spectra.\n\n## Desired state\n\n- `config.yaml` has `cross_correlation.estimator: catalog` (default) with `map` as fallback.\n- `compute_cross_spectrum.py` has a catalog branch for field creation: when `estimator == \"catalog\"`, shear uses `NmtFieldCatalog` (reads WL parquet catalog directly), density uses `NmtFieldCatalog` with spin-0 (reads GC catalog). Everything else — Knox covariance, Gaussian covariance, evidence, output format, patch masks — unchanged.\n- The Snakefile rule adds the catalog as an input when `estimator == \"catalog\"`, keeps map inputs when `estimator == \"map\"`.\n- Wall-clock times logged for both estimators on a representative subset (e.g., lensmc bin1 × ACT). Outcome records the comparison.\n- Full DAG rebuild completes cleanly (`snakemake -j20`). All 28 shear + 12 density cross-spectra recomputed. Downstream plots, evidence, tapestry all fresh.\n\n## Context\n\n- Production script: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_compute_cross_spectrum.py` — handles shear (spin-2), density (spin-0), SKSP, patch masks, Knox + Gaussian covariance.\n- Catalog validation script: `workflow/scripts/compute_catalog_cross_spectrum.py` — thin, shear-only, no covariance, no evidence. Lives in `explorations.smk`. Reference for `NmtFieldCatalog` usage patterns.\n- Catalog paths: WL `{catalog_dir}/{vcat}.parquet`, GC `{catalog_dir}/catalogRR2_v2_GC_031124.parquet`.\n- `NmtFieldCatalog` signature: `nmt.NmtFieldCatalog(pos=[ra,dec], weights, fields=[-e1,e2], lmax, spin=2, lonlat=True)`. For density spin-0: `fields=[overdensity]`.\n- Memory: ~64GB for ~5M shear galaxies at lmax=3000. Density has ~1.2M galaxies/bin — should be lighter.\n- Knox covariance comes from auto-spectra of the *fields*, which `NmtFieldCatalog` supports via `compute_coupled_cell`. No change to Knox formula needed.\n- SKSP/SKS mass maps stay map-based (no catalog equivalent).\n\n## Approach\n\nBranch inside `compute_cross_spectrum.py`, not a separate script. The field creation is the only thing that changes — everything downstream (workspace, decoupling, covariance, evidence) is field-agnostic.\n\n## Covariance\n\nKnox covariance uses auto-spectra of the fields passed to it. With `NmtFieldCatalog`, the auto-spectra include shot/shape noise naturally. No special handling needed.\n\nGaussian covariance: `nmt.gaussian_covariance` needs `NmtField`-type masks for the covariance workspace. With `NmtFieldCatalog`, the mask is implicit. Check whether `get_cov_workspace` works with catalog fields — if not, fall back to map-based masks for covariance only.\n\n## Benchmark\n\nRun both estimators on lensmc bin1 × ACT. Log wall-clock time (field creation, workspace, cross-spectrum, total). Record in fiber outcome.\n\n## Done when\n\n1. Config flag exists and defaults to `catalog`.\n2. Both shear and density cross-spectra use catalog-based field creation.\n3. Wall-clock benchmark recorded.\n4. Full DAG rebuild clean. All downstream evidence fresh.\n5. `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum.py` and its exploration rules can be retired (or marked deprecated).\n\n## Skills\n\nActivate `/snakemake` and `/tapestry` within each iteration.

For shear, bright stars cause PSF wings and diffraction spikes that locally bias shape measurements.\n\n**Galactic extinction** (`GalacticExtinction` in DPDD:113): E(B−V) reddening from the Planck thermal dust map, per Scaramella+ 2022 (`docs/arxiv/2108.01201`). Dust absorption dims and reddens galaxies, shifting them across photometric redshift bin boundaries and altering the effective selection function. The coherent spatial structure of Galactic dust makes it a low-ℓ contaminant with the same angular scales as the lensing signal.\n\n**Star brightness** (`StarBrightnessMean` in DPDD:125): mean Gaia G-band flux of stars in each pixel. Regions near bright stars suffer from scattered light halos and incomplete masking, reducing galaxy detection completeness. The wide dynamic range (5–985 at p10–p90) means a few very bright stars dominate local contamination.\n\n### B. Survey properties\n\nMaps encoding how the survey observed each region — depth, geometry, and accumulated exposure.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `exposures` | Number of VIS exposures per pixel | MER Bks Mosaic | 83% | Median 2462, stepped pattern from tile overlaps |\n| `zodiacal_light` | Zodiacal background intensity | Scaramella+ 2022 | 83% | Median 1.6×10⁻¹⁸ W/m²/sr, smooth ecliptic gradient |\n| `saa` | Solar Aspect Angle | MER Bks Mosaic | 83% | Median 92.5°, smooth spatial gradient |\n\n**Exposures** (`Exposures` in DPDD:107): total number of VIS exposures contributing to each pixel. This is the primary depth proxy — pixels with more exposures have lower noise and deeper photometry, detecting fainter galaxies. The stepped pattern from Euclid's tile overlap strategy creates sharp boundaries in effective depth, which can imprint as galaxy density discontinuities.\n\n**Zodiacal light** (`ZodiacalLight` in DPDD:115): zodiacal dust emission varying with ecliptic latitude and Earth's orbital position. Higher zodiacal background increases the effective noise floor, reducing photometric precision and shifting detection thresholds. At the ~0.01 mag level this affects photo-z accuracy and shear weight assignment.\n\n**Solar Aspect Angle** (`SAA` in DPDD:101): spacecraft orientation relative to the Sun during each observation. SAA determines the thermal state of the spacecraft, which drives optical alignment changes and detector temperature variations. Different SAA values produce slightly different PSF shapes and detector gains. The DPDD also provides Alpha Angle (AA, :103) and Beta Angle (BA, :105) — we use SAA as the primary proxy.\n\n### C. Instrument response\n\nMaps characterizing the detector and optics — how the instrument shaped the recorded signal.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `psf` | PSF FWHM (arcsec) | MER Bks Mosaic | 80% | Median 0.514, tight range (0.511–0.517 at p10–p90) |\n| `noise` | RMS noise per pixel | MER Bks Mosaic | 81% | Median 0.0038, ~30% variation across field |\n| `persistence` | Detector persistence fraction | VIS + NIS calibration | 80% | Median 0.21, wide range (0.11–0.38 at p10–p90) |\n\n**PSF FWHM** (`PSF` in DPDD:111): point spread function full width at half maximum from MER background mosaics. PSF variations directly bias galaxy shape measurements through model-fitting residuals. This is the most direct instrumental contaminant for weak lensing — imperfect PSF correction leaves E-mode and B-mode residuals proportional to the PSF anisotropy (cf. DES×SPT Appendix A, Chang+ 2023, `docs/arxiv/2203.12440`).\n\n**Noise RMS** (`Noise` in DPDD:109): root mean square background noise per pixel from MER mosaics. Noise variations change the effective signal-to-noise of shape measurements, modulating shear weights across the footprint. This correlates with both detection completeness and shape measurement precision.\n\n**Persistence** (DPDD; `docs/marseille_wl_talks_md/LE3_VMPZ_ID/LE3_VMPZ_ID.md:17`): residual charge from previous exposures in VIS and NIS detectors. Persistence creates spurious flux that biases both photometry and astrometry. The wide range (0.11–0.38 at p10–p90) suggests large spatial variation in this contaminant.\n\n### D. Derived galaxy properties\n\nMaps constructed from the galaxy catalog itself — these trace the combined effect of all systematics on the final sample.\n\n| Key | Physical quantity | Source | Coverage | Summary |\n|-----|------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| `galaxy_number_density` | Galaxy count per pixel | CatRed catalogs | 73% | Median 16.4/pix, traces depth and masking |\n| `phz_quality` | Photo-z quality (SEVENTY mean) | CatRed catalogs | 72% | Median 0.27, tail to 0.54 in low-quality regions |\n\n**Galaxy number density** (`GalaxyNumberDensity` in DPDD:117): observed galaxy count per pixel from the CatRed (catalog reduction) pipeline. This is unique among the systematic maps: it measures the same physical field we use as a tracer (galaxy overdensity δ_g). Its spatial variation encodes the net effect of all observational systematics on galaxy detection. The null test C^{δS}_ℓ for this map is expected to fail by construction — galaxy positions are physically correlated with survey depth. The VMPZ-ID ISD (Iterative Systematics Decontamination) and SOM algorithms use this map as their primary decontamination template (`docs/marseille_wl_talks_md/LE3_VMPZ_ID/LE3_VMPZ_ID.md:142–157`).\n\n**Photo-z quality** (`GalaxyRelPhZSeventyMean` in DPDD:121): the mean SEVENTY metric — the fraction of a galaxy's photo-z posterior within ±0.15(1+z) of the point estimate. Lower values indicate broader, less reliable photo-z posteriors. Regions with poor photo-z quality suffer from tomographic bin mixing: galaxies scatter between redshift bins, diluting the lensing signal in a spatially-correlated pattern. This map is delivered at nside 1024 (coarser than the other 10 maps) and is upgraded to nside 2048 for analysis.\n\n### Not included (9 types on disk)\n\nSTARBRIGHTNESSRMS, STARBRIGHTNESSSTD (redundant with mean), GALAXYNUMBERDENSITYNEGVISFLUX (subset of galaxy density), GALAXYHFLUXERR, GALAXYRELPHZSEVENTYRMS, GALAXYRELPHZSEVENTYSTD (redundant with mean), AA (ambient angle), BA (background angle), TILE (boundaries). These were inspected and either redundant with included maps or uninformative for cross-correlation systematics.\n\nCoverage fractions are the fraction of pixels within the shear footprint that have nonzero values. The ~20% of pixels without systematic map data correspond to regions outside the VMPZ-ID processing boundary (slightly smaller than the shear footprint).\n\n## Figure\n\n11×2 composite: one row per map, two columns for the north and south RR2 patches (gnomonic projection). Each panel shows the systematic map masked to the shear footprint, with 2nd–98th percentile color scaling.

Signal terms from shifted lognormal model; noise from realistic CMB+galaxy simulations. Required a 4% ad-hoc upscaling of γκ covariance to match chi2 distributions. Validated with jackknife (80 patches).\n\n**ACT×DES**: 511 lognormal simulations as primary, analytical Gaussian as cross-check. Agrees to ~0.5%. Hartlap correction applied (α ≈ 0.951).\n\n**Us**: Knox formula — `Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes` with effective fsky from Hivon 2002. Simpler, no tuning, validated empirically: sim null test shows empirical variance ratio 0.83 (Knox slightly conservative). NaMaster Gaussian covariance agrees within ~25% (ratio 1.04 density, 1.26 shear after bug fix) but has a coupling matrix artifact at the last bandpower — Knox adopted as primary for quantitative inference.\n\n**Gap**: No simulation-based covariance. Knox is sufficient for detection and null tests but insufficient for parameter inference (non-Gaussian terms, cross-bin correlations). For DR1 cosmological constraints, simulation covariance will be needed.\n\n## Intrinsic alignment\n\n**DES×SPT**: TATT model (5 parameters) — more general than NLA. Lensing ratio likelihood strongly constrains IA, improving S₈ by ~40%. Parameters from DES Y3 external priors.\n\n**ACT×DES**: NLA (2 parameters) with DES-Y1-derived priors.

A_lens = data / (ΛCDM + NLA IA). IA suppression: 36% at bin 1, 4% at bin 6. Resolves most of the ACT amplitude deficit (0.83 → 0.93). See `nla-intrinsic-alignment-theory-57e37bd1`.\n\n**Gap**: TATT for DR1 cosmological constraints. NLA sufficient for current fixed-cosmology analysis.\n\n## Shear calibration\n\n**DES×SPT**: Explicit multiplicative bias m per bin, externally constrained (Gaussian priors from Y3). CMB cross-correlations independently constrain m to 5-10%.\n\n**ACT×DES**: External m priors from DES Y3.\n\n**Us**: No explicit m parameter. Instead: metacal vs lensmc consistency test ([method comparison](.felt/lensmc-vs-metacal-method-7d4d724f.md)). Agreement to chi2/dof=0.14 (correlated noise from shared galaxies+CMB) validates calibration cross-pipeline. Empirical validation, not a model parameter.\n\n**Gap**: Explicit m parameterization needed for DR1 parameter inference. Current consistency test is sufficient for fixed-cosmology analysis.\n\n## Scale cuts\n\n**DES×SPT**: Physically motivated — OWLS AGN baryonic feedback model sets minimum angular scale per bin. Conservative: removes scales where bias > 0.3σ in S₈-Ω_m. δκ loses ~40% of S/N from scale cuts.\n\n**Us**: Fixed ℓ-range (40-3000 from NaMaster binning). Progressive ℓ_max robustness test ([ℓ-range robustness](.felt/ℓ-range-robustness-amplitude-e86f1728.md)) detects real scale-dependence: ACT stable (max 1.5σ), SPT scale-dependent (2.7σ in bin 2). More informative than fixed cuts — reveals where the data deviates rather than assuming a model for what to cut.\n\n**For DR1**: Need baryonic feedback modeling (HMCode/SP(k)) to determine appropriate scale cuts for parameter inference. `theory-model-completeness-for-526d66a5` documents missing effects: baryonic feedback 3-5%, m-bias ~2%, n(z) shifts 1-3%.\n\n## Systematic contamination\n\n**DES×SPT**: Survey property cross-correlations X^f_S(θ) measured and shown to be below measurement noise. Not integrated into budget.\n\n**ACT×DES**: Same contamination metric, shown to be <5% of Cl error.\n\n**Us**: Five-layer analysis (`systematic-contamination-five-f509e962`): (1) null test C^{fS}/σ_Knox per bandpower, (2) contamination metric X = C^{κS}·C^{fS}/C^{SS}, (3) integrated bias budget S_bias per systematic×bin×CMB, (4) template marginalization via joint Fisher fit, (5) ℓ-range robustness. Discovered stellar density as dominant ACT contaminant (up to 8σ integrated), contamination BOOSTED ACT signal (positive X), template marginalization corrects A_lens from 0.93→0.86 (profile chi2/dof=0.75). More thorough than either reference paper.\n\n## Photo-z\n\n**DES×SPT**: Shift + stretch parameters per bin, externally constrained. Hyperrank as efficient alternative.\n\n**Us**: Official Euclid RR2 n(z) used as-is (6 bins, C2020 selection). No shift/stretch parameterization.\n\n**Gap**: For DR1 parameter inference, photo-z uncertainty propagation needed.\n\n## References\n\n- DES×SPT×Planck methods: `docs/papers/2203.12439_des_spt_planck_methods/main.tex`\n- DES×SPT×Planck correlations: `docs/papers/2203.12440_des_spt_planck_correlations/main.tex`\n- ACT×DES shear: `docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex`",

All estimators worst in bin 2. Scale dependence is dominated by the temperature channel — TT and combined estimators (GMV, MV) show larger scale-dependent drops. This points to temperature-side normalization or foreground leakage rather than a universal κ transfer function.

ACT covers the full RR2 footprint; SPT covers a subset. A shape agreement across different sky could mask local disagreements.\n\nThe overlap test eliminates this. The RR2 shear footprint splits naturally into three regions based on CMB κ coverage: ACT-only (0.47% fsky), ACT+SPT overlap (0.27% fsky), and SPT-only (0.08% fsky). In the overlap region, both experiments observe exactly the same CMB modes through the same galaxies. Any difference is purely CMB-side — reconstruction algorithm, noise properties, transfer function.\n\nThe 6-panel spectral overlay shows ACT and SPT cross-spectra in the overlap region. Knox error bars are larger than the full-footprint case (fsky_overlap / fsky_full ≈ 0.3), but the signal is clearly detected in every bin (ACT median 10σ, SPT median 8.3σ). The chi2 of the difference spectrum (ACT − SPT) tests whether the two are drawn from the same underlying signal. Joint chi2/dof = 1.01 (120 dof), PTE = 0.46.

Possibilities:\n1. **Noise misspecification**: We feed `coupled_cell / mean(m*m)` as input spectra — are these the right \"guess\" spectra? gctools does the same (`cls[i,j] = compute_coupled_cell(fi,fj)/mean(mi*mj)`), so pattern matches.\n2. **Small fsky breakdown**: At fsky=0.01, the mode-coupling matrix is poorly conditioned. The decoupling step may amplify variance.\n3. **Missing noise bias subtraction**: Auto-spectra include shape noise. Knox uses these directly. NaMaster covariance propagates them through mode-coupling, which may amplify.\n4. **Workspace caching issue**: Covariance workspace computed from wrong field pair?\n\n**Goal**: If NaMaster Gaussian covariance can be made accurate, use it everywhere instead of Knox. This would also unblock the B×κ null test (NaMaster handles BB properly when EE is correct).\n\n**Diagnostics**:\n- Compare NaMaster vs Knox vs empirical (from sim null test scatter) variance\n- Check whether noise Cl specification in NmtField changes the result\n- Check whether catalog-based (no mode coupling) gives different covariance\n- Read NaMaster docs on INKA (Improved Narrow Kernel Approximation)",

Root cause: NaMaster's Gaussian covariance formula performs poorly at very low sky fractions where mode coupling is severe and the coupling matrix inversion amplifies errors.

This would also unblock the B×κ null test.\n\nBlocked on the investigation fiber: need to understand why NaMaster Gaussian was overestimating EE variance by 10-130× before adopting it. If that was a bug, this switch is straightforward. If it's fundamental (small fsky breakdown), need to decide whether conservative errors are acceptable.\n\n**Scope**: All cross-spectrum error bars, all chi2 tests, all S/N calculations, all evidence.json fields. Every plot that shows error bars would change.\n\n## Comments\n**2026-02-18 03:23** — Outcome was premature. NaMaster Gaussian covariance must work — it's the standard in the field.

      "body": "The third probe of the 3×2pt data vector. Where [γκ](.felt/the-signal-cmb-lensing-cosmic-b92a2965.md) and [δκ](.felt/galaxy-density-cmb-lensing-δκ-a755afc3.md) cross-correlate galaxy tracers with CMB lensing, κκ measures the CMB lensing field against itself.\n\nNeither [DES×SPT](../docs/papers/2203.12440_des_spt_planck_correlations/main.tex) nor [ACT×DES](../docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex) included κκ in their cosmological data vectors — they used cross-correlations only. DES×SPT computed κκ as a validation check only, using RDN0 + N₁ debiasing. Good reason: κκ is significantly harder than the galaxy × κ cross-correlations.\n\n## What we measured\n\n**ACT × ACT auto-spectrum.** A_lens = 0.25 ± 0.01. Simple N₀ subtraction removes ~75% more than it should — the released ACT N_L curve overshoots the actual noise bias, or N₁ (which is positive) compensates. The debiased spectrum doesn't match theory shape at all (chi2/dof = 59000). This confirms that auto-spectrum debiasing requires realization-dependent N₀ (RDN0, per Namikawa 2012) plus N₁ from common-κ simulations, as DES×SPT did.\n\n**SPT × SPT auto-spectrum.** A_lens = −0.07 ± 0.01. Even worse — the N₀ computed from 11 simulations oversubtracts to produce a negative spectrum. With fsky = 4% and ~2000 modes per bandpower, the auto-spectrum signal (C_ℓ^{κκ} ~ 10⁻⁸) is swamped by N₀ ~ 10⁻⁶. The subtraction of two large numbers to get a small residual is inherently unstable.\n\n**ACT × SPT cross-spectrum.** A_lens = 2.1 ± 0.03. This should be noise-free (independent reconstructions), yet shows 2× the expected signal with terrible shape (chi2/dof = 620). The overlap is tiny: fsky = 2.6%, only ~1400 modes per bandpower. The NaMaster mode-coupling matrix becomes ill-conditioned at such small sky fractions, likely inflating the deconvolved spectrum.\n\n## What this means\n\nκκ needs infrastructure we don't have:\n- **Auto-spectra**: RDN0 + N₁ simulation framework (not just simple N₀ subtraction)\n- **Cross-spectrum**: Larger sky overlap (the 2.6% ACT ∩ SPT region is too small for stable deconvolution) or simulation-calibrated mode-coupling\n\nThe pipeline (`compute_kappa_spectrum.py`) works correctly as NaMaster machinery — the issue is astrophysical, not software. κκ is a future deliverable when proper N₀/N₁ infrastructure exists.",
      "outcome": "Infrastructure complete, results document the physics limits. Auto-spectra need RDN0+N1 (neither reference analysis had this either). Cross-spectrum needs larger overlap than 2.6%. Pipeline compute_kappa_spectrum.py + plot_kappa_spectrum.py work correctly as NaMaster machinery. κκ is a future deliverable — filed for when simulation infrastructure exists. Neither DES×SPT nor ACT×DES included κκ in cosmological data vectors.",

B/E amplitude ratios range 0.20–0.96, consistent with E→B leakage at our sky fraction (~4%).\n\nThe covariance breakthrough was recognizing that the Knox formula with *observed* BB auto-spectra — which include the leaked E-mode power — correctly captures the leakage-inflated variance. NaMaster's Gaussian covariance uses theoretical BB ≈ 0, underestimating variance by 15–150× and producing false failures. Knox sidesteps this entirely: `Var(C^{Bκ}_b) = C^{BB,obs}_b × C^{κκ}_b / n_modes`. No simulations needed.\n\nThis is comparable to [ACT×DES](../docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex), which reported PTE = 0.81 using 511 Monte Carlo realizations for covariance.\n\nThis test complements the [jackknife null test](.felt/jackknife-null-test-random-sign-e86273e8.md) (random sign-flip destroys correlated signal) and the [simulation null test](.felt/sim-null-test-spt-κ-sims-are-0f7e6bf3.md) (uncorrelated CMB maps).

      "body": "Tighten the tapestry — the analysis and its presentation — by working through child fibers that each address a specific gap, cleanup, or extension. Previous loops built the infrastructure, made it inspectable, and shaped it into narrative. This loop tightens: close open questions, restructure where the analysis outgrew its scaffolding, extend coverage, and clean up what we've learned doesn't belong.\n\n## Desired State\n\nEvery child fiber is closed with an outcome. The tapestry is internally consistent: node titles match what the plots show, the DAG is correct, evidence timestamps are fresh.\n\nA scientist seeing this for the first time can follow the story cold — which probes were measured, what was found, what was checked, what remains open. Presentation quality matches analysis quality: no orphan nodes, no stale evidence, no titles that describe method when they should describe findings.\n\nWork proceeds in rough priority order:\n\n1. **NaMaster covariance** (`namaster-covariance-validate-07e17cab`) — the 31× overestimate is likely a guess spectra format mismatch, not structural. sp_validation and gctools both work. Fix this first: everything downstream (chi2, S/N, likelihood, null tests) depends on correct error bars.\n2. **Cleanups** — descope, strip stale references, standardize evidence format, restructure the DAG. Mostly fiber edits and tag hygiene, no computation.\n3. **Extensions** — bring probes to equal footing, complete the systematic maps inventory, restructure contamination analysis. These touch snakemake rules and plots.\n4. **Open questions** — estimator benchmarking, anomalous features, template marginalization. These require computation and may reshape how we present results.\n5. **Reference** — DES×SPT paper, when bandwidth allows.\n\n## Child Fibers\n\nEach is a self-contained spec. Read it with `felt show <id>` before starting work; close it with an outcome when done.\n\nCheck current children with `felt downstream ralph-titan-tapestry-b5db47d7`.\n\n## Working Discipline\n\n**One fiber at a time.** Read the child spec, do the work, close it with an outcome. Half-finishing three things produces three incomplete things.\n\n**Outcomes are the documentation.** What was done, what was found, what changed — the fiber outcome replaces any other record. Future instances navigate by the DAG of outcomes, not by memory.\n\n**Follow the data.** When work on one fiber reveals something that belongs to another, note it on that fiber. When it reveals something genuinely new, file a new fiber and link it here.\n\n**Every pipeline change touches the tapestry.** After any change to scripts, config, or rules, use `/tapestry` to review which nodes are affected. Update fiber titles, outcomes, and evidence to reflect what actually changed. A tapestry node that describes stale decisions — like \"map-based chosen as production\" after we switched to catalog — is worse than no node at all. The tapestry is the record of what the analysis *is*, not what it was.\n\n**Presentation is continuous work.** Every time you touch a node, ask whether the result is clear to someone seeing it fresh. Sharpen titles, prune redundant plots, improve axis labels. The tapestry is how we communicate the analysis; it should always be getting more legible, not just more complete.\n\n**Rerun evidence after major changes.** Any change that affects plot outputs should be followed by a snakemake run on the affected targets — and the child fiber shouldn't close until that evidence is fresh. Check the DAG first (`snakemake -n <target>`); if it wants to rebuild, let it.\n\n**Long jobs: use snakemake-tmux.** For any run expected to take > 5 min, use `snakemake-tmux -j{n} {target}` — a transparent wrapper that runs in a detached tmux session. Stay and shepherd: poll with `snakemake-peek <session>`, sleep proportionally (30s for minute-scale, 5m for hour-scale). Don't exit and hope the next iteration finds the right state. If a lock error occurs, check `tmux ls | grep smk-` first — the lock may be legitimate.\n\n**Read plots sparingly.** Never load more than 5 images per session. Each image is context that could go toward work.\n\n**Tapestry tag hygiene.** One fiber per `tapestry:` tag. When retiring a node, remove the tag — don't delete the fiber. When creating a node, verify the specName isn't already taken.\n\n## Context\n\n### Key file paths\n\n- **Snakefile**: `workflow/Snakefile` + `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`\n- **Scripts**: `workflow/scripts/`\n- **Config**: `cmbx/files/config_config.yaml`\n- **Fiber files**: `.felt/*.md`\n- **Evidence**: `results/claims/{specName}/`\n- **Results**: `results/rr2_v2_1_wl_031224-v0.0/`\n\n### Code references\n\n- **gctools** (authoritative masking/spectra): `code/dr1_cmbx/src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/gctools/spectra.py`\n- **eDR1like** (theory + likelihood): `code/dr1_cmbx/src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1like/`\n- **nx2pt** (NaMaster tools): `code/nx2pt/src/nx2pt/`\n- **sp_validation** (catalog reference): `cmbx/files/sp_validation_src_sp_validation_cosmo_val.py`\n- **DES×SPT paper**: `cmbx/files/docs_papers_des_spt_shearxlensing_2026_shearXlensing_20260202.pdf`\n\n### Doc fibers (consolidated knowledge)\n\n- `namaster-technical-patterns-60d42621` — sign conventions, masking, I/O\n- `systematic-contamination-five-f509e962` — five-layer contamination methodology\n- `spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41` — SPT 24% deficit characterization\n- `snakemake-workflow-discipline-88f4f4f8` — DAG discipline\n- `findings-synthesis-euclid-cmb-03354e57` — comprehensive narrative of all tapestry nodes\n\n### Execution\n\n```bash\nsnakemake -j20 {target}              # production (SLURM)\nsnakemake --profile serial -j1 {target}  # serial partition\nsnakemake -n {target}                # dry run\nsnakemake-tmux -j{n} {target}        # long jobs (detached tmux)\nsnakemake-peek <session>             # check on running jobs\n```\n\n### Previous constitutions (reference, don't repeat)\n\n- `cross-correlation-pipeline-v2-1e4a96bc` — built the infrastructure (32 iterations)\n- `research-tapestry-inspectable-fef1295c` — made it inspectable (31 iterations)\n- `narrative-tapestry-compress-31-6c42a4d6` — shaped the narrative (11 iterations)\n- `tapestry-iteration-open-fibers-b1115ae0` — iteration + δκ integration (20 iterations)\n\n## Skills\n\n- `/tapestry` — fiber ↔ evidence ↔ plot conventions\n- `/snakemake` — workflow execution, rule design\n- `/implementing-code` — script development\n- `/data-visualization` — figure design\n- `/felt` — fiber management\n\n## After the children close\n\nWhen all child fibers are closed, the loop shifts into two open-ended modes, alternating by taste:\n\n**Learn from the paper.** Read `cmbx/files/docs_papers_des_spt_shearxlensing_2026_shearXlensing_20260202.pdf` — DES×SPT shear×lensing using the same SPT-3G maps, the reference analysis closest to ours.

Pattern: reads `overlap_act_vs_spt_evidence.json` (per-rule output from script), writes `evidence.json` with `input`, `output`, `params` wrapper. Added to `localrules`. Ran 12 compute + plot + aggregate jobs; `cmbx/files/results_claims_plot_overlap_comparison_evidence.json` now exists with proper format.\n- **Pattern established**: for single-output plot rules, add a small `aggregate_*_evidence` localrule that wraps the script's named evidence file into a standardized `evidence.json`. The script itself keeps its named output (e.g., `overlap_act_vs_spt_evidence.json`) for granularity.\n- Remaining: 21 tapestry nodes still lack `input`/`output`/`params` fields. All have `evidence.json` but with older format (`id`, `generated`, `evidence`, `artifacts`). Migration requires updating each aggregate rule's `run:` block or the plot script directly.\n\n**Iteration 4 (2026-02-18):**\n- **Core fix**: Modified `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_aggregate_evidence.py` to auto-detect PNG/PDF files in the claims directory and include them in an `output` dict. Added `input: {}` and `params: {}` stubs. This is a single-script change that covers all ~20 aggregate rules using this script.\n- **Approach**: Auto-detecting PNGs from `output_path.parent.glob(\"*.png\")` rather than hardcoding per-rule. The `output` dict is built at runtime after plots exist.\n- **Cascade accepted**: Running aggregate rules triggered a pre-existing code-change cascade for density cross-spectra (12 jobs), jackknife null (24), and sim null (66). These are code-change provenance triggers from a previous iteration's script edit, not from this change. Per project philosophy: run them (`-j20`). Snakemake session `smk-060606` running.\n\n**Iteration 5 (2026-02-18):**\n- smk-060606 completed (242/242 steps). All aggregate_evidence rules using `aggregate_evidence.py` now have new format with `input`, `output`, `params`.\n- **Confirmed new format** (has input/output/params): plot_act_vs_spt, plot_jackknife_null_test, plot_sim_null_test, plot_contamination_metric, plot_systematic_budget, plot_spt_estimator_comparison, plot_theory_comparison, plot_method_comparison, plot_deprojected_spectra, evaluate_fiducial_likelihood, evaluate_deprojected_likelihood, build_likelihood_input, plot_overlap_comparison, plot_theory_residual_analysis, plot_redshift_trend (18 nodes).\n- **Still old format** (write evidence directly from plot scripts, not aggregate_evidence.py): `plot_systematic_null_tests`, `plot_catalog_validation_summary`, `plot_apodization_masks`, `plot_systematic_maps`, `plot_bmode_null_test` (5 nodes).\n- `compare_nz_distributions`: Updated via `generate_compare_nz_evidence` → now generates `nz_kernel_overlay.png` as second figure, evidence has n_plots:5 and kernel stats.\n- **Next**: Update 4-5 remaining plot scripts to include input/output/params in their evidence writes, then close.\n\n## Done when\n\n1. All 22 tapestry nodes have `evidence.json` with `input`, `output`, `params` fields.\n2. Dashboard renders only plots listed in `output`.",
      "outcome": "All 22 tapestry nodes now have evidence.json with input/output/params fields. Two-phase approach: (1) aggregate_evidence.py auto-detects PNGs and adds stubs — covers 18 nodes using that script (done in iteration 4-5). (2) Direct evidence writers — 5 scripts updated this iteration: plot_apodization_masks.py, plot_catalog_validation_summary.py, plot_systematic_null_tests.py, plot_systematic_maps.py all got input/output/params added to evidence_doc. aggregate_bmode_null_evidence run block in explorations.smk got same treatment plus Path import. 9 jobs ran (smk-063304, all 9/9 complete). Evidence format verified programmatically for all 5 scripts. Dashboard can now render output-listed images and display params/inputs for all tapestry nodes.",

Now remove all references to deprojection/marginalization from remaining tapestry fiber bodies. Search `.felt/*.md` for \"deproject\", \"marginali\", \"naive subtraction\", \"Fisher matrix\" (in contamination context), \"plot_deprojected\", \"evaluate_deprojected\".

But Fisher marginalization isn't convincing either:\n- ACT lensmc: A_lens 0.93 → 0.86 (1.2σ shift), S/N 20σ → 15σ (25% loss)\n- Templates may be mostly noise (C^{SS} is noise-biased from sparse maps), so the Fisher matrix absorbs degrees of freedom without actually correcting the signal\n\nDES×SPT found contamination negligible and didn't marginalize at all. Our contamination looks much worse, but the marginalization doesn't behave like it's removing real signal corruption.\n\n## What to investigate (later)\n\n- Is the C^{SS} noise bias so severe that X templates are mostly noise?\n- Do simulation-based templates give more sensible marginalization?\n- What does the contamination look like in the overlap region?\n- Is the bias budget (S_bias up to 8σ) itself inflated by C^{SS} noise bias?",

Restructure into a clean three-node path that shows the raw ingredients, not just the summary.\n\n## Current state\n\nThree closed tapestry fibers:\n- `systematic-null-test-heatmap-92dec7e5` (`tapestry:plot_systematic_null_tests`) — C^{fS}/σ pulls, shear only\n- `contamination-metric-product-c-e55501f4` (`tapestry:plot_contamination_metric`) — combined X metric, composite 5×2 grid\n- `systematic-bias-budget-709ea507` (`tapestry:plot_systematic_budget`) — integrated S_bias heatmap\n\nProblems: (1) only shear, no density; (2) only the combined X metric is shown, not the raw spectra that compose it; (3) too many individual plots (50+), none showing all bins at once; (4) C^{SS} noise bias unaddressed.\n\n## Desired state: three fibers on one path\n\n### 1. Systematic maps (already exists: `systematic-maps-on-the-sky-83122c03`)\n\nRoot node. Sky-projection plots of all VMPZ-ID maps. Already being expanded separately.\n\n### 2. Systematic spectra → rework `plot_systematic_null_tests`\n\nShow the raw cross-spectra that enter the contamination metric. For each systematic map, one plot with all 6 bins overlaid, for both ACT and SPT:\n\n- **C^{fS}**: tracer × systematic (shear E-mode or density). Currently exists for both γ and δ.\n- **C^{κS}**: CMB κ × systematic. Currently exists for all 5 CMB experiments.\n- **C^{SS}**: systematic auto-spectrum. Already saved in NPZ (`cl_sys_auto`). This is the denominator — showing it makes the noise bias problem visible.\n\nFor each data vector (γκ with lensmc, γκ with metacal, δκ with density) × each CMB experiment (ACT, SPT-GMV at minimum), produce one composite figure per systematic showing all three spectra with all bins. The reader sees the ingredients before the ratio.\n\n### 3. Contamination metric + budget → rework `plot_contamination_metric`, absorb budget\n\nFor each systematic, one plot showing:\n- X(ℓ) = C^{κS} · C^{fS} / C^{SS} with all bins overlaid, for both ACT and SPT\n- Integrated bias significance S_bias annotated\n\nDo this for both γκ and δκ. The budget heatmap can remain as a summary panel (or the metric plots can carry S_bias annotations directly).\n\nRemove `tapestry:plot_systematic_budget` tag from the budget fiber — it merges into this node.\n\n### C^{SS} noise debiasing\n\nThe systematic auto-spectrum C^{SS} is noise-biased (downgrading sparse maps from nside 16384→2048 adds pixel noise). This inflates the denominator, making X a lower bound on the true contamination. Options to investigate:\n- Cross-spectrum of two independent systematic map realizations (if available — unlikely for VMPZ-ID)\n- Analytic noise bias from pixel variance at original nside\n- Smoothed C^{SS} (fit a power law or template, avoiding noise-dominated scales)\n\nShowing C^{SS} explicitly in the spectra fiber makes this problem inspectable.\n\n### Scope: both probes on equal footing\n\nEvery contamination plot exists for both γκ (shear × CMB κ) and δκ (density × CMB κ). The density contamination is much worse (24–28σ vs 4–8σ for shear) — showing both side by side is essential context.\n\n### Summary plot\n\nA single figure that summarizes contamination across all systematics × all probes × both CMB experiments. Could be: S_bias heatmap with rows = systematics, columns grouped by (γκ-ACT, γκ-SPT, δκ-ACT, δκ-SPT). Or a bar chart. The summary is the last panel, not the only panel.\n\n## Done when\n\n1. Systematic spectra fiber shows raw C^{fS}, C^{κS}, C^{SS} for all bins, both probes, baseline CMB experiments.\n2. Contamination metric fiber shows X(ℓ) + S_bias for all bins, both probes.\n3. Budget fiber's tapestry tag removed, content merged.\n4. Density and shear on equal footing throughout.\n5. C^{SS} noise bias documented (solution or explicit caveat).",
      "outcome": "Restructured contamination analysis into a four-node tapestry path: maps → spectra → metric → budget.

(2) Null tests extended to density (null-tests-extended-to-density-5c949fca). (3) Systematic spectra script created (systematic-spectra-plot-raw-6dbe8e47). (4) Budget kept as separate tapestry node — provides unique integrated S_bias significance (up to 14σ) that per-bandpower metric doesn't capture. Deviation from spec: kept 4 nodes instead of 3, because budget and metric show genuinely different summaries. C^{SS} noise bias is documented as a caveat (X is a lower bound) but not solved — would require either cross-spectrum of independent systematic realizations or analytic pixel noise model.",

These are prerequisites.\n- **Parallel branches**: theory, null tests, and contamination all flow from measurement independently. They don't depend on each other.\n- **One synthesis node**: the analysis summary figure, with inline tables. No separate LaTeX results table — we're far from a paper. Remove `generate_results_table` from the tapestry.\n- **Systematic maps** feed into contamination from the methodology column (they're inputs to null tests, not results).\n\n## Node changes\n\n1. **Sky/data** (`plot_field_overview`) — stays as root. The intro node.\n\n2. **n(z)** (`compare_nz_distributions`) — child of sky/data. Two plots: shear n(z) for 6 bins + CMB κ lensing kernel overlay, density n(z) for 6 bins + CMB κ kernel. Read directly from n(z) FITS files, not pre-existing plots.\n\n3. **Apodization** (`plot_apodization_masks`) — flows from sky. On the main spine now.\n\n4. **Estimator choice** — rework `catalog_validation_summary` from \"validation\" to \"choice of estimator.\" Shows catalog-vs-map comparison, documents the decision. Flows from apodization.\n\n5. **Cross-spectra** — merge `signal_overview` and `redshift_trend` into one node. Raw cross-spectra for all 6 bins, both ACT and SPT, both γκ and δκ. **No theory curves.** Blind-safe.\n\n6. **Theory** (parallel branch) — theory comparison, residual analysis, likelihood. Blinding boundary.\n\n7. **Null tests** (parallel branch) — consistency tests + null tests. Systematic contamination is a null test.\n\n8. **Contamination** (parallel branch, or sub-branch of null tests) — systematic spectra, metric + budget. Feeds from both measurement and systematic maps (methodology).\n\n9. **Synthesis** — one figure. The current analysis summary, but with inline tables replacing the separate LaTeX results table node. Remove `tapestry:generate_results_table`.\n\n## DAG regions\n\nFive regions, left to right. Regions 3-4 are parallel.\n\n1. **Data** — sky, n(z). What we observe.\n2. **Methodology** — apodization, estimator choice, systematic maps. How we analyze.\n3. **Measurement** — cross-spectra. What we measured. Blind-safe.\n4. **Validation** (parallel branches from measurement):\n   - *Theory*: comparison, residual, likelihood.\n   - *Consistency*: ACT vs SPT, methods, estimators.\n   - *Null*: jackknife, sim, spatial, B-mode.\n   - *Contamination*: spectra, metric+budget.\n5. **Synthesis** — one summary figure.\n\nNo backward edges. Each region depends only on things to its left. Theory and null tests are in the same column — they're parallel explorations of the measurement.\n\n## Blinding rationale\n\nRegions 1-3 (data, methodology, measurement) are safe to share. Region 4 (validation) crosses the blinding boundary where theory curves appear. Separating these means the first three columns can go to WL-SWG or CMBX-SWG without revealing cosmological comparisons.\n\n## Node removals and simplifications\n\n### Spatial variation → absorbed by overlap comparison\n\nThe north/south spatial variation test (`plot_spatial_variation`) is superseded by the ACT×SPT overlap comparison (`plot_overlap_comparison`) — same sky, same galaxies, stronger test. Remove `plot_spatial_variation` from the tapestry. The overlap node stays as a consistency test.\n\n### SPT estimator comparison → simplify\n\nCurrently a ratio plot (TT/PP/MV divided by GMV). Simplify to residuals in units of σ: (GMV − TT)/σ and (GMV − PP)/σ. Only two comparisons per bin (MV is redundant with GMV). One subplot per bin, all in one figure. This is a consistency check — are the estimators giving the same answer? The σ-normalized residual is the cleanest way to show that.\n\n## Done when\n\n1. Sequential spine: sky → n(z) / apodization → estimator → spectra (no theory).\n2. Theory and null tests branch in parallel from spectra.\n3. One synthesis node with inline tables. Results table node removed from tapestry.\n4. Merged spectra node shows both γκ and δκ, no theory curves.\n5. Estimator node framed as methodology choice with comparison plots.\n6. Each node assigned to a region. No backward edges.",

Nine child fibers closed: spatial_variation removed, deprojection references stripped, early spine rewired, region labels assigned, catalog_validation reworked into estimator-choice node, results_table removed, SPT estimator simplification with sigma-normalized residuals, n(z) kernel overlay added, signal_overview made theory-free with trend companion.

      "body": "Move from Knox diagonal error bars to NaMaster Gaussian (harmonic-space) covariance as the primary covariance for all cross-spectra. This is foundational — every chi2, S/N, likelihood, and null test downstream depends on correct error bars.\n\n## Background\n\nPrevious investigation found NaMaster Gaussian overestimated by ~31× (median) after fixing a double-coupling bug. That was diagnosed as \"structural at low fsky\" — but this conclusion is likely wrong. Both gctools and sp_validation use `gaussian_covariance()` at comparable sky fractions and get reasonable results. The problem was almost certainly in how we constructed the guess spectra.\n\n## The likely fix: coupled vs uncoupled guess spectra\n\n**sp_validation** (`cosmo_val.py:2679`) has a `fiducial_input_inka` flag:\n- When `coupled`: explicitly applies the coupling matrix to theory+noise spectra and divides by `<mask²>`\n- gctools does the same: passes `compute_coupled_cell(fi,fj) / mean(mi*mj)` as guess spectra\n\n**cmbx after the \"fix\"** passes uncoupled theory+noise spectra. This mismatch — passing uncoupled spectra where the function may expect coupled — is the most likely source of the remaining 31× overestimate. The double-coupling fix reduced the upper tail but didn't address the fundamental question of what format `gaussian_covariance()` expects.\n\n**Action**: Read the NaMaster API docs for the `coupled` kwarg of `gaussian_covariance()`. Then replicate exactly what sp_validation does.\n\n## Catalog estimator + map-based covariance\n\nThe catalog-based estimator (`NmtFieldCatalog`) doesn't expose masks, so `gaussian_covariance()` can't build a covariance workspace from it. Solution: build the covariance workspace from the **map-based masks** (shear weight map + CMB mask), and apply the resulting covariance to the catalog-measured spectra. The covariance depends on sky geometry and signal+noise power, not on how the spectrum was estimated.\n\n## Reference implementations\n\n1. **sp_validation**: `/leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083/cdaley00/sp_validation/src/sp_validation/cosmo_val.py`\n   - `calculate_pseudo_cl_eb_cov()` at line 2679\n   - Covariance workspace: `NmtCovarianceWorkspace.from_fields(f,f,f,f)` where `f` is map-based `NmtField`\n   - Guess spectra: theory + noise (analytic or from randoms), optionally coupled via coupling matrix\n   - Noise: variance map × pixel_area, decoupled, then re-coupled if `fiducial_input_inka == 'coupled'`\n\n2. **gctools**: `code/dr1_cmbx/src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/gctools/spectra.py`\n   - `get_cov()` at line ~172\n   - Passes `compute_coupled_cell(fi,fj) / mean(mi*mj)` — coupled pseudo-C_ℓ normalized by mean mask²\n\n## Desired state\n\n- NaMaster Gaussian covariance computed for every cross-spectrum (γκ and δκ, all bins, ACT + SPT).\n- Covariance workspace built from map-based masks (even when using catalog estimator for spectra).\n- Guess spectra format matches what gctools/sp_validation use (likely coupled).\n- Validated against simulation null test empirical scatter and Knox diagonal.\n- Full covariance matrix (with off-diagonals) deployed in all chi2, S/N, and likelihood calculations.\n- Knox retained as diagnostic cross-check.\n\n## What NaMaster needs\n\n`nmt.gaussian_covariance()` requires:\n- Covariance workspace (from mask power spectra)\n- Four guess spectra: C^{ab}, C^{cd}, C^{ac}, C^{bd} for Cov(C^{ab}, C^{cd})\n- For cross-spectrum C^{κE}: C^{κκ} (theory + N_L), C^{EE} (theory + shape noise), C^{κE} (theory signal)\n\nTheory spectra from `compute_theory_cls.py`. Noise: ACT N_L / SPT N_0, shape noise from NOISE_CL in FITS headers.\n\n## Validation\n\nCompare NaMaster Gaussian variance (diagonal) against:\n1. Knox variance (should be similar for diagonal)\n2. Empirical variance from 11 SPT simulation null spectra\n\nIf diagonal agrees with empirical to within ~20%, deploy as primary.\n\n## Previous issues\n\n- Double-coupling bug (fixed) — explained upper tail, not the median\n- The 31× median overestimate is NOT structural — it's a guess spectra format issue\n- Covariance workspace is separate from spectrum workspace\n- B-mode covariance remains problematic (E→B leakage at partial sky) — separate issue\n\n## Done when\n\n1. NaMaster Gaussian covariance computed for all cross-spectra.\n2. Validated against simulation empirical scatter.\n3. Deployed as primary error bars in all downstream calculations.\n4. Knox retained as diagnostic cross-check.\n5. Documented in a tapestry node (methodology region).",
      "outcome": "Root cause: diagonal extraction bug. NaMaster gaussian_covariance() interleaves spectral components for spin-2 × spin-0 — output is (2*nbins, 2*nbins) with layout (bin, component). np.diag(cov)[:nbins] mixed Eκ and Bκ variances and mismatched bins, inflating the apparent NaMaster/Knox ratio to ~31×. Fix: reshape to (nbins, n_cls, nbins, n_cls), extract [:, 0, :, 0] diagonal. Added extract_covariance_diagonal() to nmt_utils.py and fixed all 5 call sites. Validated: shear × systematic at fsky=0.0044 gives NaMaster/Knox = 1.26 (was ~31×). Density (spin-0, no interleaving) was already 1.04. The 'structural at low fsky' conclusion was wrong — the approximation works fine down to fsky ~0.004. NaMaster Gaussian covariance is now deployable as primary error bars. Separately: fixed SLURM profile — dcgp_qos_bprod requires min 17 nodes (wrong for single-node jobs), switched to dcgp_qos_lprod + 30min runtime for backfill scheduling.",

The residual panel requires the reader to compare residuals against the error bars visually — it's not self-documenting about whether the difference is consistent with noise.\n\nThe cleaner diagnostic: sigma-normalized residuals `(C_alt - C_GMV) / σ_GMV`. These directly show \"how many standard deviations do TT/PP/MV differ from GMV\" — a flat distribution around zero means consistent estimators. Outliers are immediately visible as |Δ/σ| > 2.\n\n## Desired state\n\nThe residual panel in `plot_spt_estimator_comparison.py` shows:\n- y-axis: `(C_alt - C_GMV) / σ_GMV` (sigma-normalized pull)\n- Horizontal reference lines at ±1σ, ±2σ (dashed gray)\n- y-label: `Δ / σ_GMV`\n- Each estimator (TT, PP, MV) as a separate line\n\nThe main panel (top) stays — it shows the actual spectra with error bars.\n\n## What changes\n\n1. **`plot_spt_estimator_comparison.py`**: In the residual panel (`ax_resid`), compute `(cl_alt - cl_gmv) / err_gmv` instead of `cl_alt - cl_gmv`. Add ±1σ and ±2σ reference lines. Update y-label.\n2. **`plot_spt_estimator_composite.py`**: May need updating if it includes residual panels. Check.\n3.

The coupling matrix for shear has EE/EB/BE/BB blocks — larger and potentially less well-conditioned than spin-0. B-modes especially affected. First few multipole bins most vulnerable.\n\n2. **Euclid WL-SWG investigation**: DR1 mask has challenging geometry — disconnected regions, irregular shapes. A study is being set up to test NaMaster covariance numerical stability by progressively excluding problematic mask features. Related to the partial-sky validation task: currently passing only the footprint to NaMaster, not the full heracles shear weight maps.\n\n## Possible connection to SPT ℓ≈100 spike\n\nThe SPT cross-spectra show a suspicious single-bandpower feature at ℓ≈100 (`spt-ℓ-100-spike-suspicious-ed5a480a`). This is exactly the regime where mask-inversion instability would manifest — low ℓ, partial sky, spin-2 fields. Worth investigating whether the spike is a mask artifact rather than (or in addition to) something in the SPT data.\n\n## What to investigate\n\n- Condition number of the mode-coupling matrix for our mask at low ℓ, spin-0 vs spin-2.\n- Whether the spike persists when using a simpler (e.g., apodized-only, no disconnected patches) mask.\n- Whether passing the full weight map (not just the binary footprint) to NaMaster changes the low-ℓ behavior.\n- How the WL-SWG DR1 mask stability study progresses — follow that thread.\n\n## Context\n\n- Our mask: `apodize(weight > 0, 0.15, \"C2\") * weight` for shear; `apodize(mask, 0.15, \"C2\")` for CMB.\n- NaMaster workspace caches the coupling matrix and its inverse — recomputing with a modified mask requires a new workspace.\n- We don't use `purify_b=True` (nor do gctools, ACT×DES, DES×SPT).\n- The Gaussian covariance already underestimates B-mode variance by 15–150× due to E→B leakage (`namaster-gaussian-covariance-9373b1fa`).

Spin-0 × spin-0 is poorly conditioned but finite (ACT: 7e11, SPT: 1e15). (2) Despite this, the BINNED roundtrip test (couple → decouple) is PERFECT: amplification = 1.0 ± 2e-14 at every bandpower, including the lowest ℓ bins. NaMaster's bandpower binning projects out the singular directions. (3) Conclusion: the SPT ℓ≈100 spike is NOT a coupling matrix inversion artifact.

Need timing, peak memory, and an investigation into whether NmtFieldCatalog requires the full catalog in memory.\n\n## What to measure\n\nRun both estimators on the same target (e.g., lensmc bin1 × ACT) and compare:\n\n1. **Wall-clock time** — total and broken down: field creation, workspace computation, cross-spectrum, covariance (map only).\n2. **Peak memory** — use `/usr/bin/time -v` or equivalent to get max RSS. Current expectation: ~64GB catalog, unknown for map. The 64GB may be dominated by the catalog load rather than the harmonic transform.\n3. **Streaming feasibility** — can NmtFieldCatalog accept galaxies in chunks, or does it need all positions at once for the SHT? Check NaMaster source/docs. If full load is required, can we reduce memory by dropping columns early or using float32?\n\n## Context\n\n- Catalog: `NmtFieldCatalog(pos=[ra,dec], weights, fields=[-e1,e2], lmax, spin=2, lonlat=True)` — ~5M galaxies at lmax=3000.\n- Map: `NmtField(mask, [Q,U], spin=2, lmax=lmax)` — HEALPix nside=2048 maps.\n- Current catalog timing: ~3–4 min/job (from fiber outcome, not benchmarked).\n- Map timing: unknown (never measured against catalog).\n- The 64GB SLURM allocation may be conservative — actual peak RSS could be lower.\n\n## Approach\n\nAdd timing instrumentation to `compute_cross_spectrum.py` (or a thin benchmark wrapper). Run one job each way via snakemake with `/usr/bin/time -v` to capture RSS. Compare.\n\nFor streaming: read NaMaster's `NmtFieldCatalog` implementation to understand whether it builds an internal map or does a direct catalog→alm transform. If it builds a map internally, streaming won't help (and catalog vs map may be doing the same thing under the hood with extra overhead).",
      "outcome": "Code analysis (no benchmark needed): NmtFieldCatalog does a direct catalog→a_lm transform via ducc0.sht.adjoint_synthesis_general() — no intermediate HEALPix map. Memory: ~7 GB peak for 5M galaxies at lmax=3000 (confirmed by sacct), comparable to map-based (~4-8 GB at nside=2048). Streaming: not supported — all galaxy positions/values must be passed at initialization; ducc0 SHT expects full arrays. Wall clock: ~3-4 min/job (catalog) from production runs. Map-based timing unknown but expected similar since both ultimately compute SHTs. Key advantage of catalog: avoids pixelization artifacts. Key disadvantage: no get_mask() (raises ValueError), no NaMaster covariance support. The 64GB→8GB SLURM allocation change was validated by sacct — the original overprovisioning wasn't due to catalog memory requirements but conservative estimation. No side-by-side benchmark needed: catalog is default, validated against map within 1σ, and memory is well-characterized from production runs.",

The noise plateau is visible as a flat floor in the third panel of each figure.\n- **C^{κS} is small**: CMB κ × sysmap cross-spectra are consistent with zero for most sysmaps, confirming that CMB lensing maps are not significantly contaminated by Euclid-specific systematics.\n- **C^{fS} structure**: Tracer × sysmap spectra show real signal for density (galaxy positions correlate with observational depth by construction) and varying levels of correlation for shear methods.\n- **Method consistency**: Where lensmc and metacal disagree on C^{fS}, it may indicate a method-specific sensitivity to that systematic.\n\n## Implementation\n\nOne figure per sysmap, 11 total.

      "body": "Two independent covariance estimates — NaMaster Gaussian (harmonic-space, mask-aware) and Knox formula (analytic mode counting) — agree within ~25% for density × CMB κ cross-spectra across all 6 redshift bins and both CMB experiments. This validates the error bars used throughout the analysis.\n\n**NaMaster Gaussian covariance** uses the Improved Narrow Kernel Approximation (INKA) with theory+noise guess spectra: C^{κκ} + N_L for the CMB auto, C^{EE/δδ} + shape/shot noise for the galaxy auto, and C^{fκ}_theory for the cross. This captures mask mode-coupling effects that the Knox formula ignores.\n\n**Knox formula** uses analytic mode counting: Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes_b, with n_modes from fsky_eff (Hivon 2002). Independent of mask geometry beyond the effective sky fraction.\n\nThe ratio NaMaster/Knox ≈ 1.04 for density (spin-0 × spin-0) and ≈ 1.26 for shear (spin-2 × spin-0, map-based). The >1 ratio is expected: mode coupling from partial sky mixes power between bins, increasing variance beyond what Knox predicts.\n\n**For catalog-based shear** (production default): the NaMaster Gaussian covariance is computed using an auxiliary map-based NmtField. The catalog field measures the spectrum (via NmtFieldCatalog), but the covariance workspace requires map-domain masks that NmtFieldCatalog can't expose. Since covariance depends on mask geometry and auto-spectra (not the measurement method), the map-based covariance is valid for catalog spectra. This gives uniform NaMaster error bars across all probes.\n\n**Bug history**: An interleaved diagonal extraction bug inflated the apparent NaMaster/Knox ratio to ~31× for spin-2 fields. The NaMaster `gaussian_covariance()` output for spin-2 × spin-0 is (2·nbins, 2·nbins) with Eκ and Bκ components interleaved as (bin0_Eκ, bin0_Bκ, bin1_Eκ, ...). Plain `np.diag(cov)[:nbins]` mixed components from wrong bins. Fixed via `extract_covariance_diagonal()` in `nmt_utils.py`.\n\n**Script**: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_covariance_validation.py`",

Role split: NaMaster for plot error bars (captures mode coupling), Knox for S/N annotations and likelihood chi2/PTE/A_lens (avoids coupling matrix artifact at ℓ~2700). Catalog-based shear uses map-based auxiliary NmtField for covariance since NmtFieldCatalog cannot expose masks.

      "body": "## Desired State\n\nThe tapestry reads as a story. A collaborator landing cold can traverse it and understand the analysis — what was measured, whether it's real, what contaminates it, how robust it is.\n\n### Progressive disclosure IS the tapestry\n\nThe hierarchy isn't inside figures — it's the DAG topology itself. Nodes are like sections in a paper. At first view, a reader sees a handful of top-level nodes. Clicking into any node reveals its neighborhood: linked methodology, detail, and context nodes. It's a hierarchical zoom on the project.\n\n- **Top-level nodes**: The story at a glance. Flexible number — as many as the story needs, but each earns its place.\n- **Neighborhood nodes**: Methodology, validation, detail that unfolds when you enter a top-level node. Apodization, estimator choice, covariance — these surround the measurement node.\n- **Per-wildcard evidence**: Within any node, the plots themselves can have depth. Hero figure up front, composites and per-wildcard plots accessible underneath.\n\nThis replaces the phase-1 tapestry entirely. When phase 2 is complete, the old 24-node tapestry is deleted. Phase-1 nodes may be reused, modified, or replaced — whatever serves the narrative.\n\n### Figure invariants\n\n- Top-level nodes show the **all-bin** result by default. Per-bin detail lives in composites or neighborhood nodes.\n- Three CMB baselines: **ACT, SPT-GMV, SPT-PP**. GMV is highest-SNR, PP is least-biased — both matter. TT/MV are consistency checks in a dedicated SPT-internal node.\n- Three galaxy tracers: **lensmc, metacal, density**. These are the columns of the analysis.\n- Each node answers **one question**. If it needs a paragraph to explain what you're looking at, it's two nodes.\n\n### Plot DRY\n\nMany plotting scripts follow the same pattern: load NPZ cross-spectra → plot C_ℓ with errorbars → overlay theory → compute residuals. As composites are built, extract shared patterns into `plot_utils.py` or a `composite_utils.py`. Don't build the abstraction before the second use — let it emerge from concrete figures.\n\n## Context\n\n### Phase-1 tapestry (being replaced)\n\n24 nodes, all closed with evidence. 220 PNGs across `results/claims/`. Regions: data (2), methodology (4), measurement (1), validation:consistency (4), validation:contamination (5), validation:null (3), validation:theory (3), synthesis (1).\n\nKey fibers to consult:\n- `felt show 706364a6` — field overview (current maps node)\n- `felt show findings-synthesis-euclid-cmb-03354e57` — comprehensive narrative of all nodes\n\n### Wildcard dimensions\n\n```\ntom_bins = [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\"]     # 6 tomographic bins\nall_bins = [\"all\"] + tom_bins             # 7 total\nshear_methods = [\"lensmc\", \"metacal\"]     # 2 shear pipelines\nall_methods = [\"lensmc\", \"metacal\", \"density\"]  # 3 galaxy tracers\ncmbk_baseline = [\"act\", \"spt_winter_gmv\"]       # 2 primary CMB maps\nspt_variants = [\"spt_winter_gmv\", \"spt_winter_tt\", \"spt_winter_pp\", \"spt_winter_mv\"]\n```\n\nCMB baselines for heroes: ACT + SPT-GMV + SPT-PP (3). SPT-TT/MV are consistency only.\n\nPrimary matrix: 7 bins × 3 tracers × 3 CMB = 63 data vectors. With 11 systematics: 63 × 11 = 693 contamination assessments. The tapestry must make this comprehensible.\n\n### Key file paths\n\n- Plot scripts: `workflow/scripts/plot_*.py`\n- Shared utilities: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_utils.py`, `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_spectrum_utils.py`\n- Rules: `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`\n- Evidence: `results/claims/{specName}/`\n- Config: `cmbx/files/config_config.yaml`\n- Existing field overview: `workflow/scripts/plot_field_overview.py`\n- Density maps: `results/rr2_v2_1_wl_031224-v0.0/gc/`\n\n### Starting point: maps node\n\nThe first node to build. Current `plot_field_overview` shows ACT κ, SPT κ, and shear weights (3 rows × 2 patches). Modify it to a 2×2 grid:\n- Row 1: Shear weights (all bins, north | south)\n- Row 2: Density overdensity (all bins, north | south)\n\nCMB κ maps get their own node eventually — separate from the Euclid data overview. The maps node answers: \"what Euclid data are we cross-correlating?\"\n\n`build_density_map` produces per-bin maps. An \"all\" bin aggregation is needed (check if it already exists; if not, add it).\n\n### Existing rules can be modified\n\nWhen a phase-2 node replaces a phase-1 node's function, modify the existing rule rather than creating a parallel one. The old tapestry is being replaced, not preserved. Avoid duplication.\n\n## Skills\n\nActivate before working:\n- `/snakemake` — for rule definitions and execution\n- `/tapestry` — for fiber/evidence conventions\n- `/implementing-code` — for script changes\n\n## Evidence\n\nProgress is measured by:\n- `felt ls -t tapestry` — do new nodes exist?\n- `ls results/claims/*/evidence.json` — does each node have computed evidence?\n- Visual inspection: does the figure compress information? Can you understand it without reading the script?\n- The number of top-level nodes should grow steadily across iterations, each one earning its place in the narrative.\n\n### Quality bar\n\nA node is done when:\n1. It answers its question in one visual at the top level\n2. All-bin result is prominent; per-bin is accessible but not dominant\n3. Three CMB baselines (ACT, GMV, PP) appear where relevant\n4. Evidence.json has meaningful metrics (not just file lists)\n5. A collaborator unfamiliar with the figure can interpret it within 30 seconds\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- **Dashboard progressive disclosure**: How to implement \"click to expand\" in the force-directed DAG? Regions? Collapsed subgraphs? This is interface work — deferred but the DAG structure should support it.\n- **Density \"all\" bin**: Does `build_density_map` already produce an aggregated map across bins 1-6? If not, how to combine (mean δ? weighted sum?).\n- **Tapestry tag namespace**: Should phase-2 nodes use a different tag prefix or region scheme to distinguish them from phase-1 while both coexist? Or just replace phase-1 tags as nodes are rebuilt?\n- **Node inventory**: The full set of top-level nodes hasn't been prescribed — it should emerge from building them one at a time. Candidates include: maps, CMB κ, the signal (cross-spectra), redshift scaling, experiment consistency, method consistency, SPT estimators, systematic budget, null tests, detection/likelihood, synthesis. But the number is flexible.",

Convenience wrappers (make_shear_mask etc.) stay in scratch.\n- **Group buy-in matters**: Cail is championing a Claude-first approach. Code quality must be demonstrably high to build confidence.\n\n## Design Principles\n- **get_cl returns all spectral components** — no data reduction at measurement level. EE, EB, BE, BB all returned for spin-2 auto.\n- **pickle_spectra does pure extraction** — takes cl[0] for E-mode, stores cl_bb/nl_bb for B-mode. No arithmetic (no EE-BB subtraction). Shape noise debiasing happens upstream in get_cl via nl_uncoupled.\n- **Covariance uses field.spin** — not string-based detection. get_full_cov delegates to compute_gaussian_covariance.\n- **Weights before apodization in make_mask** — all boundaries (including interior weight zeros) get smooth transitions. Correct for galaxy density with effcov.\n- **Workspace caching is first-class** — hash-based file caching via get_workspace/get_cov_workspace.\n- **pol_conv parameter** — explicit COSMO/IAU convention handling in make_field.",

Two shear measurement pipelines (lensmc, metacal), galaxy density from the GC catalog, and 11 VMPZ-ID systematic maps. The footprint covers ~385 deg² across two spatial patches. Masking follows spectra.make_mask: weights multiplied into the binary footprint, then C2 apodized.\n\n## Shear maps\n\n- **Pipelines**: lensmc, metacal — independent shape measurement methods\n- **Per-bin products**: e₁/e₂ shear maps, sum_weights, n_eff\n- **All-bin**: union across `config[tomography.bin_ids]`\n- **Sign convention**: Euclid e₁ along RA; HEALPix Q along colatitude → [-e₁, e₂] for NaMaster (pol_conv=COSMO)\n- **Noise**: NOISE_CL in FITS headers = σ²_comp / n_eff_sr (flat shape noise per component)\n\n## Galaxy density maps\n\n- **Source catalog**: `config[gc_catalog]` (parquet)\n- **Bins**: `config[gc_tom_bins]`\n- **Products**: δ overdensity + selection mask per bin\n- **Density mask is strictly binary**: `build_density_maps.py` sets mask = 1 for every occupied pixel, 0 elsewhere. Only one distinct non-zero value (confirmed bin=3). `make_convergence_mask` then applies `apodize(mask > 0) * mask`, which is apodize(binary) * 1 — the weight factor contributes nothing extra (contrast with shear where `weights=[weight_map]` tapers by varying galaxy weights).\n- **Shot noise**: N_ℓ = 1/n̄_sr (constant per mode)\n\n## CMB lensing mask apodization\n\n`make_cmb_mask` calls `nmt.mask_apodization(mask, aposcale, \"C2\")` on the input. The ACT DR6 baseline mask is already the official 3° cos² apodized lensing mask (Qu+ 2023 Sec 5.3). Applying a second 0.15° C2 pass changes mask pixel values by at most 6.3×10⁻⁴ (rms 2.6×10⁻⁵), zero change in fsky — negligible. This is benign: the long-scale ACT apodization dwarfs the 0.15° second pass.\n\n## Systematic maps\n\n11 VMPZ-ID maps at nside 16384 (NESTED), downgraded to analysis nside at load time:\nstellar_density, galactic_extinction, exposures, zodiacal_light, saa, psf, noise, persistence, star_brightness_mean, galaxy_number_density, phz_quality\n\n## Tomographic binning\n\n`config[tomography.n_bins]` bins (IDs: `config[tomography.bin_ids]`). Shear n(z) from `config[nz.wl]`; density n(z) from `config[nz.gc]`.\n\n## Weight masking\n\nspectra.make_mask(): binary footprint × weights, then apodize. Scale: `config[cross_correlation.aposcale]`°. For density, weights=[binary mask], so C2 apodization acts on a hard edge — visible rolloff at the footprint boundary. For shear, weights=[sum_weights], so the taper is smoothed by varying galaxy counts before apodization.\n\n## Estimator\n\n`config[cross_correlation.estimator]`: catalog (NmtFieldCatalog, bypasses map-making) or map (NmtField).\n\n## Apodization audit\n\nVisualized in `cmbx/files/results_claims_euclid_density_apodization_euclid_density_apodization.png` (rule `plot_euclid_density_apodization`).

      "body": "## Desired State\n\nFive doc fibers in the maps tree each have a sky-map figure and evidence, rendering them as visible tapestry nodes. Each plot answers one question about its data — what it covers, what it looks like, what its properties are. A collaborator clicking through the tapestry sees the actual sky before any cross-correlation. The node is only \"done\" when the figure is both scientifically correct and visually legible on first read.\n\n### The five nodes\n\n| specName | Fiber | Question | Content |\n|----------|-------|----------|---------|\n| `shared_map_conventions` | Maps: shared conventions | Where do the three surveys overlap? | All three footprints on the sky — overlap areas labeled. **Replaces** existing `plot_field_overview` rule. |\n| `cmb_lensing_maps` | CMB lensing maps | What does the CMB convergence look like? | ACT + SPT κ maps side by side, Wiener-filtered, on the RR2 footprint. |\n| `act_dr6_lensing` | ACT DR6 lensing | What does ACT see here? | **Plot 1**: ACT κ (Wiener-filtered). **Plot 2**: ACT κ × apodized mask — what enters the estimator. |\n| `spt_winter_lensing` | SPT-3G winter lensing | What does SPT see here? | **Plot 1**: SPT GMV κ (Wiener-filtered). **Plot 2**: SPT GMV κ × apodized mask. |\n| `euclid_rr2_maps` | Euclid RR2 maps | What galaxy data are we crossing against? | **Plot 1**: Shear weights + density (2 rows). **Plot 2**: Same data × apodized mask. |\n\n### Two plots per individual node\n\nThe last three nodes (`act_dr6_lensing`, `spt_winter_lensing`, `euclid_rr2_maps`) each produce **two separate PNGs**:\n1. **Unmasked** — the data on the sky (κ Wiener-filtered, or shear weights + density)\n2. **Apodized** — the same data multiplied by the C2 apodization mask, showing what actually enters the cross-correlation\n\nBoth PNGs listed in `evidence.json` `output`. The contrast between the two tells the story: how much sky survives apodization, where the edges roll off, what structure the estimator actually sees.\n\n### Done conditions\n\n- Each node has `results/claims/{specName}/evidence.json` + at least one PNG (3 nodes have 2 PNGs each)\n- Each snakemake rule runs via SLURM (these load full-sky FITS maps — not localrules)\n- Plots use existing infrastructure: `RR2Coverage`, `skyproj.GnomonicSkyproj`, `setup_theme`, `save_evidence`\n- CMB κ maps Wiener-filtered for visualization; weights/density maps shown as-is\n- Colormaps follow doc fiber conventions: κ → `RdBu_r`, shear → `icefire`, weights/density → cubehelix\n- Evidence includes nside, overlap areas, pixel counts, fsky — whatever characterizes the map\n- For ACT/SPT/Euclid nodes: evidence also includes mask statistics (fsky raw, fsky apodized, area deg², aposcale, effective overlap)\n- Scripts live in `workflow/scripts/plot_{specName}.py`; rules in `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`\n- Each of the last 3 rules declares two PNG outputs (e.g., `png_map` and `png_mask`)\n- Wiener filter function extracted to `plot_utils.py` (shared across CMB κ scripts)\n- Plot readability pass completed for every node using `/data-visualization` criteria: clear title/question match, readable colorbar scale, non-clipped dynamic range, obvious patch orientation (north/south consistency), and explicit titles for all subplots/panels.\n- Aesthetics pass completed for every node: typography consistent with `setup_theme`, balanced whitespace/margins, color choices perceptually clear and convention-compliant, no distracting clutter.\n- Unmasked vs apodized pair tells a visible story at a glance for ACT/SPT/Euclid (edge rolloff and surviving support are immediately apparent without reading evidence JSON).\n\n### What NOT to do\n\n- Don't create per-bin or per-method variants. Each node shows the \"all\" bin or primary estimator.\n- Don't build new abstractions. Use `RR2Coverage.from_mask()` + `draw_hpxpix()` directly.\n- Don't add tomographic structure — these are spatial/map nodes, not redshift nodes.\n- Don't preserve `plot_field_overview` as a parallel rule — it gets replaced by `shared_map_conventions`.\n\n### Resolved decisions\n\n- **`plot_field_overview` → `shared_map_conventions`**: Replace. Retag the existing fiber (`the-sky-act-spt-and-euclid-on-706364a6`) from `tapestry:plot_field_overview` to `tapestry:shared_map_conventions`, rename the rule, move the evidence directory.\n- **Euclid content**: Shear weights + density overdensity (2 rows × 2 patches).\n- **SPT content**: GMV only. PP belongs in `plot_spt_estimator_comparison`.\n- **Wiener filter**: Extract to `plot_utils.py` for now.\n\n### Relationship to existing rules\n\n- `plot_field_overview` → becomes `shared_map_conventions` (repurposed, not duplicated)\n- `plot_apodization_masks` — separate concern, untouched\n- `plot_shear_maps` — per-bin diagnostic, untouched\n- `plot_systematic_maps` — VMPZ-ID inventory, untouched\n\n## Context\n\n### File paths\n\n- Rule definitions: `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`\n- Plot scripts: `workflow/scripts/plot_*.py`\n- Shared utilities: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_utils.py` (FW, FH, setup_theme, save_evidence, COLORS, LABELS)\n- Coverage class: `cmbx/files/code_dr1_notebooks_src_dr1_notebooks_scratch_cdaley_rr2.py` — `RR2Coverage`\n- Evidence output: `results/claims/{specName}/`\n\n### Existing patterns to follow\n\nEvery map visualization script follows the same skeleton:\n1. Load maps via `hp.read_map` (dense FITS) or `read_healpix_map` (sparse FITS)\n2. Build `RR2Coverage.from_mask(nside, mask_union)` for the visualization extent\n3. Sparsify data via `coverage.sparsify(map_data)`\n4. Compute vlim from 1st-99th percentile of finite nonzero sparse data\n5. Create `skyproj.GnomonicSkyproj(ax, **proj_params)` for each of 2 patches (north/south)\n6. `sp.draw_hpxpix(nside, coverage.ipix_sparse, sparse_data, ...)`\n7. `save_evidence(evidence_dict, path, snakemake)`\n\nProjection parameters (hardcoded in `rr2.py` and replicated in scripts):\n```python\nproj_params = [\n    {\"lon_0\": 70, \"lat_0\": -33, \"extent\": [63.8, 77.2, -37, -26.5]},  # north\n    {\"lon_0\": 45, \"lat_0\": -64, \"extent\": [32, 70, -44, -63.5]},       # south\n]\n```\n\n### Wiener filter\n\nAlready implemented in `plot_field_overview.py` (lines 80-133). Uses Planck 2018 C_ℓ^{κκ} as signal model: W(ℓ) = C_theory / (C_theory + N_estimate). Extract to `plot_utils.py` as `wiener_filter_kappa(map_data, mask, nside, lmax=None)`. Only used for CMB κ visualization — shear/density maps don't need filtering.\n\n### Data inputs (paths from Snakefile)\n\n- ACT κ: `cmb_experiments[\"act\"][\"kappa_map\"]`\n- ACT mask: `cmb_experiments[\"act\"][\"mask\"]`\n- SPT κ (GMV): `cmb_experiments[\"spt_winter_gmv\"][\"kappa_map\"]`\n- SPT mask: `cmb_experiments[\"spt_winter_gmv\"][\"mask\"]` (shared across estimators)\n- Shear weights (all bins): `euclid_maps_dir / f\"wl_lensmc\" / f\"...bin=all_sum_weights_map.fits\"`\n- Density map (all bins): `results/{vcat}/gc/overdensity_bin=all.fits` — check if exists; if not, build it\n- ACT noise curve: `act/N_L_kk_act_dr6_lensing_v1_baseline.txt`\n- SPT N₀: `results/{vcat}/noise_curves/spt_winter_gmv_N0.txt`\n\n### Resources\n\nAll scripts load full-sky HEALPix FITS at nside 2048. SLURM, not localrules. 8 GB default; `shared_map_conventions` may need 16 GB (loads 3 map pairs).\n\n## Skills\n\nActivate before working:\n- `/snakemake` — for rule definitions and execution\n- `/tapestry` — for evidence conventions\n- `/implementing-code` — for script quality\n- `/data-visualization` — for figure design and plotting patterns\n\n## Iteration focus\n\nPrioritize **reading the generated plots**, not just producing them. Every iteration should include:\n1. Run/generate plots.\n2. Inspect PNGs for interpretability and aesthetics.\n3. Verify figure title + each subplot title clearly identifies the field/mask state shown.\n4. Make targeted plotting refinements (limits, labels, layout, colormap normalization, annotation clarity).\n5. Re-run and re-check until visual quality is publication-grade for doc-fiber usage.\n\n## Evidence\n\nProgress measured by:\n- `felt ls -t tapestry: | grep -E \"shared_map|cmb_lensing|act_dr6|spt_winter_l|euclid_rr2\"` — do all 5 have fibers?\n- `ls results/claims/{shared_map_conventions,cmb_lensing_maps,act_dr6_lensing,spt_winter_lensing,euclid_rr2_maps}/evidence.json` — does each have evidence?\n- `snakemake -n plot_shared_map_conventions plot_cmb_lensing_maps plot_act_dr6_lensing plot_spt_winter_lensing plot_euclid_rr2_maps` — dry run clean?\n\n## Open Questions\n\n\n- Decide and document whether additional C2 apodization (`aposcale`) on top of pre-apodized ACT/SPT masks should remain `0.15 deg` or be changed via objective scan (variance/edge leakage tradeoff).\n- **Density \"all\" bin**: Does `build_density_map` already produce an all-bin aggregation? If not, how to combine — mean δ? weighted sum? This may need a new rule upstream of `euclid_rr2_maps`.\n\n### Implementation preference\n\n- Prefer `dr1_cmbx` library utilities for map I/O, mask handling, and analysis conventions wherever equivalent functionality exists.\n- Only use ad-hoc script-local implementations when no `dr1_cmbx` utility exists; if this happens, note the gap and keep the implementation thin.",

This analysis measures C_ℓ^{γκ} and C_ℓ^{δκ} between Euclid RR2 weak lensing shear / galaxy density and CMB lensing convergence from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G (winter), across 6 tomographic bins.\n\n**Headline result**: Both cross-correlations are detected at high significance with ACT DR6 after resolving the Euclid position-angle sign convention (`pol_conv=\"EUCLID\"` → [-e1, +e2] for NaMaster; see `shear-sign-convention-test-b751c2ca`). Galaxy density × CMB-κ: A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (ACT, χ²/dof = 1.07), 0.857 ± 0.050 (SPT). Shear × CMB-κ: A_lens = 0.880 ± 0.052 (lensmc × ACT, 17σ), 0.850 ± 0.055 (metacal × ACT, 15σ), 0.694 ± 0.045 (lensmc × SPT), 0.697 ± 0.048 (metacal × SPT). After marginalizing over 11 systematic contamination templates: density A_lens = 0.986 ± 0.122 (ACT), 0.812 ± 0.122 (SPT); shear A_lens = 0.824 ± 0.095 (lensmc × ACT), 0.780 ± 0.097 (metacal × ACT). SPT shows a persistent 15–20% amplitude deficit across all tracers — a CMB-side normalization issue under investigation (`spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41`).\n\n**Motivation**: CMB lensing × cosmic shear is insensitive to additive shear systematics (which don't correlate with the CMB) and CMB lensing multiplicative biases — making it a robust, nearly model-independent probe of the projected matter distribution at z ~ 0.3–1.5. Euclid's wide southern survey provides the galaxy data; ACT and SPT provide CMB lensing over overlapping patches of 261 deg² and 115 deg² respectively.\n\n**Comparator analyses**: \n- DES × ACT DR6: Qu+ 2023 (`docs/papers/2309.04412_act_des_shear/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT methods: Chang+ 2022 (`docs/papers/2203.12439_des_spt_planck_methods/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT correlations: Omori+ 2022 (`docs/papers/2203.12440_des_spt_planck_correlations/main.tex`).\n- DES × SPT 2026 update: `cmbx/files/docs_papers_des_spt_shearxlensing_2026_shearXlensing_20260202.pdf`.\n- ACT DR6 lensing power spectrum: Madhavacheril+ 2024 (`cmbx/files/docs_arxiv_2304.05202_act_dr6_lensing_power_main.tex`).\n- SPT-3G winter lensing: `cmbx/files/docs_papers_spt_winter_lensing_apssamp.tex`.\n\n**Collaboration**: SPT-Euclid MoU (DR1-KP-CMBX-3/2) — see [MOU proposal](.felt/spt-euclid-mou-collaboration-6de6bc54.md).

      "body": "Angular cross-power spectra are estimated via the NaMaster pseudo-Cℓ formalism (Alonso+ 2019), which corrects for mode-coupling induced by partial-sky masks through a coupling matrix and decouples into bandpowers. This section describes the estimators, masking, and covariance used throughout the analysis.\n\n## Pseudo-Cℓ estimation\n\nWe measure cross-power spectra C^{fκ}_ℓ between Euclid tracers (shear γ or galaxy density δ) and CMB lensing convergence κ. All spectra are computed at nside=2048, lmax=3000, using 20 linearly-spaced bandpowers.\n\n### Map-based estimator (production)\n\nThe production estimator operates on HEALPix maps. Shear maps enter NaMaster as spin-2 fields (`NmtField` with `pol_conv=\"IAU\"`, lmax=3000); density overdensity maps and CMB κ maps enter as spin-0 fields. The mode-coupling matrix is computed from the apodized mask geometry and cached via `joblib` hash of the mask alms — the expensive coupling matrix computation happens once per mask pair and is reused across tomographic bins and shear methods.\n\nFor shear: `make_field([e1_map, e2_map], mask, spin=2, pol_conv=\"IAU\")`. For density: `make_field([delta_map], mask, spin=0)`. For CMB κ: `make_field([kappa_map], cmb_mask, spin=0)`.\n\nRules: `compute_cross_spectrum` (spectra.smk). Library: `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data.spectra` — `make_field()`, `get_spectrum()`, `get_workspace()`.\n\n### Catalog-based estimator (validation)\n\nThe catalog estimator bypasses map-making entirely: `NmtFieldCatalog` takes individual galaxy positions and ellipticities as a point cloud and computes spherical harmonic transforms in position space. This eliminates pixelization artifacts. Agreement with the map estimator — median bandpower correlation r=0.998, A_lens consistent within 1σ for every bin — confirms that map construction introduces no measurable bias.\n\nCovariance for the catalog path uses an auxiliary map-based `NmtField` from the same shear maps, since `NmtFieldCatalog.get_mask()` raises ValueError. The covariance depends on mask geometry and auto-spectra, not the measurement method, so this is valid.\n\nRule: `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum` (explorations.smk). ~8 GB, 3-4 min/job at lmax=3000.\n\n## Masking and apodization\n\nPartial-sky pseudo-Cℓ estimation requires apodized masks to suppress spectral ringing from sharp survey boundaries. Four input masks — Euclid shear (continuous weights × binary footprint), Euclid density (binary), ACT DR6 (pre-apodized with 3° cosine-squared rolloff), and SPT-3G (border-apodized) — are C2-apodized at 0.15 rad (~8.6°), producing 10 mask products: 4 individual + 6 pairwise cross-products.\n\nShear masks: `footprint × weight_map → C2(0.15)`. The continuous weight map creates a smooth taper. Density masks: binary footprint → C2(0.15), producing only a ~9 arcmin edge taper. CMB masks: pre-apodized by experiment + additional 0.15° C2 pass (negligible for ACT, shapes SPT border).\n\nEffective sky fractions (Hivon fsky_eff): shear×ACT 0.70%, shear×SPT 0.32%, density×ACT 0.67%, density×SPT 0.30%.\n\nRules: `build_rr2_apodized_masks`, `build_apodized_pair_masks` (maps.smk). Library: `make_mask()`, `make_cmb_mask()`.\n\n## Covariance estimation\n\nTwo independent estimates validate each other:\n\n**Knox formula** (primary for all χ²/PTE/S/N): `Var(C^{ab}_b) = C^{aa}_b · C^{bb}_b / n_modes_b` where `n_modes = Σ(2ℓ+1) · fsky_eff` with `fsky_eff = <w1·w2>² / <w1²·w2²>` (Hivon+ 2002 Eq. 17). Analytic, immune to coupling matrix numerics.\n\n**NaMaster Gaussian** (error bars in plots): Uses the Improved Narrow Kernel Approximation (INKA) with theory+noise guess spectra. For spin-2 × spin-0, output is `(2·nbins, 2·nbins)` with interleaved E/B components — extracted via `extract_covariance_block` to the `(nbins, nbins)` E-mode block. Known artifact: last bandpower (ℓ≈2700) has near-zero variance from coupling matrix numerics (~1000× below Knox). This is why Knox is used for quantitative inference.\n\nNaMaster/Knox ratio: 1.04 median for density (spin-0), ~1.26 for shear (spin-2). The >1 ratio reflects mode coupling from partial sky mixing power between bins — expected behavior.\n\n## Implementation\n\nCore library: `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data.spectra` (`cmbx/files/code_dr1_cmbx_src_dr1_cmbx_eDR1data_spectra.py`). Key functions: `make_mask()`, `make_field()`, `make_catalog_field()`, `get_spectrum()`, `map2cls()`, `get_workspace()`, `compute_knox_variance()`, `extract_covariance_block()`.\n\nSnakemake rules: `compute_cross_spectrum` (production), `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum` (validation), `build_rr2_apodized_masks`, `build_apodized_pair_masks`, `compute_systematic_cross_spectrum`.",

The density systematic budget is severe (galactic extinction up to 12.6σ bias for ACT, stellar density 6.3σ) — template marginalization is mandatory for density. Shear systematics are clean (median χ²/dof = 1.29, 74% pass).

At present this does no harm and matches gctools conventions.\n\n**Open issue — fsky_eff and mask powers**: For the Gaussian covariance, the effective sky fraction is `fsky_eff = <w_A² w_B²> / (<w_A²><w_B²>)` (Hivon+ 2002), which involves the *product* of squared masks. The broader apodization of the CMB masks (3° rolloff) means the fsky_eff for the cross-spectrum is set by the CMB mask geometry, not just the Euclid footprint. More importantly, the covariance requires the power spectrum of the mask product — a broader CMB apodization changes the mask power spectrum (smoother → less coupling between modes), and potentially shifts power into the C^BB_ℓ terms for spin-2 fields. This needs to be accounted for properly once we move from approximate Gaussian covariance to simulation-based covariance. For now the NaMaster Gaussian covariance handles this via the actual mask maps passed in, so it is correct by construction — but the fsky_eff diagnostic quoted in evidence files uses a Knox approximation that may underestimate uncertainty near the mask edges.\n\n**Decision**: Keep current double-apodization (negligible effect, gctools consistency).

      "body": "## Desired State\n\nThe analysis pipeline is a single coherent system — legible, reproducible, and still alive. Every computation flows through shared library code, formalized Snakemake rules, and shared utilities. There is one way to do each thing, and it's the right way.\n\nThis is built layer by layer, each layer checking the one beneath it. Formalizing cross-spectra reveals gaps in masking. Formalizing plotting reveals inconsistencies in how spectra are stored. The iteration works *downward* as much as forward — reassessing foundations as the structure grows.\n\nNew analysis may emerge. When it does, grapple with the results, document the decision, continue. Formalization makes the instrument more trustworthy, not more rigid.\n\n## Rhythm\n\nThis is a collaboration. The human steers, reshaping the constitution as understanding deepens. Ralph surveys, proposes, implements. The interaction is where taste lives.\n\nEach iteration:\n\n1. **Survey** — What is stable? Where to build? Use `felt ls`, `felt show`, `felt upstream`, `felt downstream`. Check `felt downstream pipeline-formalization-db91ef79` for queued work. Read open and active fibers.\n\n2. **Choose** — Highest-value intervention. Propose before acting on anything substantial.\n\n3. **Implement and run** — Make the change, verify the DAG with `snakemake -n`, then actually run. Shepherd SLURM jobs to completion — sleep, check, repeat. Don't exit hoping the next iteration picks it up. A fiber is NOT done until computation has produced output.\n\n4. **Reflect on results** — Read the plots. What are they *saying*? Do numbers make sense? Does a figure answer the question it was supposed to answer? Previous decisions can and should be revisited based on evidence. Writing code that compiles is not completion.\n\n5. **Weave the tapestry** — Not a cleanup step — woven through the work. Close fibers with outcomes as you go. Open new ones as things emerge. Every tapestry fiber must have a lede paragraph — not a sentence, a real paragraph that orients a reader: what question this node answers, what was found, and why it matters. One-sentence stub fibers are not acceptable.\n\n\n### The layers\n\n1. **Library** — `dr1_cmbx.eDR1data` (maps_refactor branch, now live). Authoritative. Use the highest-level function that applies: `map2cls()` for end-to-end, `get_spectrum()` for single pairs. Don't reimplement what the library does.\n2. **Scratch library** — `dr1_notebooks/scratch/cdaley/`. Growing analysis library: `spectrum_utils`, `plot_utils`, `snakemake_helpers`. `nmt_utils` stripped to `load_systematic_map` only — everything else now calls `dr1_cmbx` or `nmt` directly.\n3. **Compute rules** — Snakemake rules calling library functions → NPZ outputs. Import from `dr1_cmbx` and scratch, not from each other.\n4. **Plot rules** — NPZ → figures + evidence. Wildcard explosion is the enemy. One composite per scientific question, not one plot per combination. The goal is a handful of figures a collaborator can absorb in a meeting.\n5. **Rule structure** — `rules/maps.smk`, `rules/spectra.smk`, `rules/systematics.smk`, `rules/tapestry.smk` = production. `rules/explorations.smk` = research front. Everything that isn't production-ready lives in explorations.\n\n### What NOT to do\n\n- Don't speculatively improve `maps_refactor` — but if a real gap surfaces (something the library didn't anticipate, or a clear bug), file it and fix it.\n- Don't add abstraction for a single use. A function used once belongs inline; a function used three times belongs in the library.\n- Don't close fibers until computation has run and you have read the results.\n\n## Production Pipeline\n\nThe pipeline is mature. All layers are computed, all evidence current as of 2026-02-25. The DAG is clean (`snakemake -n` reports nothing to do). The default target and `generate_results_table` both complete.\n\n### Layers\n\n| Layer | Rules | Status |\n|-------|-------|--------|\n| Maps | `catalog_to_map`, `build_density_map` | Complete |\n| Masks | `build_rr2_apodized_masks`, `build_apodized_pair_masks` | Complete |\n| Spectra | `compute_cross_spectrum`, `combine_shear_cross_spectra`, `combine_density_cross_spectra` | Complete |\n| Theory | `compute_theory_cls`, `compute_cmb_noise_curve` | Complete |\n| Systematics | `compute_systematic_cross_spectrum`, `compute_cmbk_systematic_cross_spectrum` | Complete |\n| Data docs | `plot_euclid_rr2_maps`, `plot_wiener_filter_validation` | Complete |\n| Validation | `plot_act_vs_spt`, `plot_method_comparison`, `plot_theory_comparison`, `plot_redshift_trend`, `plot_signal_overview`, `plot_catalog_vs_map_composite` | Complete |\n| Null tests | `plot_jackknife_null_test`, `plot_sim_null_test`, `plot_spatial_variation` | Complete |\n| Systematics plots | `plot_systematic_null_tests`, `plot_contamination_metric`, `plot_systematic_budget`, `plot_deprojected_spectra`, `plot_systematic_spectra` | Complete |\n| Likelihood | `evaluate_fiducial_likelihood`, `evaluate_deprojected_likelihood` | Complete |\n| Results | `generate_results_table`, `plot_analysis_summary` | Complete |\n| SPT estimators | `plot_spt_estimator_composite` | Complete |\n\n### Science-blocked items\n\n- **Shear non-detection** — A_lens ≈ 0.06 (lensmc), 0.11 (metacal). Awaiting collaborator input on shear response correction (`rr2-shear-response-correction-74e90e52`).\n- **SPT normalization deficit** — A_lens = 0.857 (14% low). CMB-side origin confirmed. Needs SPT team input.\n- **B-mode covariance** — NaMaster Gaussian BB underestimates by 15-150×. Proper covariance needs simulations (ACT×DES used 511 sims).\n\n## Plot Standards\n\nEvery production plot follows `plotting-standards-57ba2ceb`. Run `felt show plotting-standards-57ba2ceb` for the full spec before writing or reviewing any plot script.\n\n- **No per-wildcard output** that isn't individually earned. Per-bin, per-experiment plots stay in explorations.\n- **Evidence**: every tapestry plot calls `save_evidence()` with a top-level `\"output\"` field so the dashboard renders the artifact.\n\n## Context\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\ndr1_cmbx.eDR1data           (maps_refactor — authoritative library)\n    spectra.py: map2cls(), get_spectrum(), make_mask(), make_field()\n    maps.py:    process_shear_catalog(), write_sparse_map()\n        ↓\ndr1_notebooks.scratch.cdaley\n    spectrum_utils, plot_utils, snakemake_helpers, nmt_utils(load_systematic_map only)\n        ↓\nworkflow/scripts/             (compute + plot scripts)\n        ↓\nworkflow/Snakefile + rules/{maps,spectra,systematics,tapestry,explorations}.smk\n        ↓\nconfig/config.yaml\n```\n\n### Production vs exploration\n\nRules that produce data consumed by other rules → production. Rules that produce figures or evidence for human inspection → exploration, unless they are named in the production pipeline above.\n\n## Skills\n\nALWAYS activate ALL of these at the start of every iteration:\n- `/snakemake` — rule definitions, execution, DAG discipline\n- `/tapestry` — evidence conventions, narrative state\n- `/implementing-code` — code quality\n- `/writing` — when modifying fiber bodies, outcomes, or any prose\n\n## Reading fibers and plots\n\nEvery iteration: read the fibers, look at the actual plots. Not skim — read. Ask: does this plot answer the question the fiber poses? Is the stated outcome still true given current data? Is the framing sharp or hedged? Does the figure follow plotting standards?\n\nThen decide: does this need better writing, reframing, rerunning, or a new plot? A fiber whose plot is stale (from before a pipeline fix, a sign-convention correction, a mask change) must be flagged and rerun. A closed fiber whose outcome no longer matches the evidence must be reopened.\n\nThis is not a cleanup step. It is the work.\n\n## Git hygiene\n\n`code/dr1_notebooks/` — rapid exploration, single user. Every iteration: commit all changes, even from previous work. Don't leave dirty state.\n\n`code/dr1_cmbx/` — shared library. Don't commit here unless explicitly asked.\n\n## Mindset\n\nThe pipeline is mature. FITS→pickle migration complete, shear sign convention resolved. The work now is: (1) keep the full DAG clean (generate_results_table, not just core), (2) respond when collaborator input unblocks science questions, (3) maintain accuracy of fibers and evidence as understanding evolves, (4) be ready for new analysis directions (TR1→DR1 transition, new systematics, response correction).\n\n## Focus areas\n\nFive spine nodes (tier:1): Introduction → Data → Methods → Validation → Results. All carry narrative prose. 31 interior tapestry nodes closed with evidence. Findings synthesis (`findings-synthesis-euclid-cmb-03354e57`) is the comprehensive document.\n\n- **Shear detection** — Sign convention resolved (pol_conv=\"EUCLID\"). lensmc×ACT A_lens = 0.880 ± 0.052 (17σ), metacal×ACT = 0.850 ± 0.055 (15σ). Strong detection.\n- **SPT normalization** (`spt-deficit-characterization-6b724e41`) — density A_lens = 0.857 (14% low, 2.9σ). CMB-side origin. Blocked on SPT team input.\n- **Density detection** — A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (ACT), solid. Template marginalization → 0.986 ± 0.122 (8.1σ). This is the headline result.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- **pol_conv EUCLID in dr1_cmbx** (`pol-conv-euclid-in-dr1-cmbx-432e25d9`): Changes to _apply_pol_conv uncommitted in shared repo. Need to coordinate with collaborators.\n- **SPT transfer function**: Is the 14% deficit in κ normalization or scale-dependent bias?\n- **B-mode covariance**: NaMaster Gaussian BB is unreliable at fsky ~ 0.01. Simulation-based covariance needed for formal B-mode null test.\n\n## Evidence\n\n```bash\nfelt ls -t tapestry: -s open       # unfinished work\nfelt downstream pipeline-formalization-db91ef79 -d summary  # queued sub-fibers\nfelt upstream <id>                 # what it rests on\n```\n\nQuestions each iteration: Are fibers closing with real outcomes? Does the DAG tell a coherent story? Do the plots answer their questions? Is `snakemake -n` clean?",
      "outcome": "Closed after 31 ralph iterations (2026-02-20 to 2026-02-25). 44 commits to dr1_notebooks. 57 downstream fibers spawned, 53 closed with outcomes, 4 remaining (3 blocked on external input, 1 living document).\n\n**What was built**: A complete, reproducible analysis pipeline for Euclid × CMB-κ cross-correlations. From raw catalogs through maps, masks, cross-spectra, theory comparison, systematics, null tests, likelihood, and results tables — all formalized as Snakemake rules with evidence provenance.\n\n**Major arcs**:\n\n1. *Infrastructure* — Snakefile split into 5 rule files (maps, spectra, systematics, tapestry, explorations). nx2pt dependency eliminated. TinyTeX PATH fixed in container. Snakemake version synced. iocache race condition patched. Resource tuning via sacct. Login node timeout mitigation.\n\n2. *FITS→pickle migration* — Write-side (build_maps, build_density_maps) and 21 read-side scripts converted from per-bin sparse FITS to per-method pickle matching dr1_cmbx format. Core target added for lean verification (~84 jobs).\n\n3. *Shear sign convention* — Resolved the central mystery. Euclid position angle (from West) differs from standard IAU (from North) by 90°. pol_conv=\"EUCLID\" → [-e1, +e2]. Shear went from non-detection (A_lens ≈ 0.06) to strong detection: lensmc×ACT = 0.880 ± 0.052 (17σ), metacal×ACT = 0.850 ± 0.055 (15σ).\n\n4. *Metrics and evidence* — S/N metric fixed twice (NaMaster→Knox, sqrt(chi2)→excess chi2). Evidence key rename (ia_A_hat → A_lens_with_IA). All 272 cross-spectrum jobs + 38 downstream plots rebuilt. Results tables with per-bin density rows.\n\n5. *Composite plots* — ACT-vs-SPT, method comparison, SPT estimator, catalog-vs-map all consolidated to composite-only (no per-wildcard explosion). Plot standards formalized.\n\n6. *Tapestry* — 5 tier:1 spine nodes, 20+ interior nodes with evidence, region tags, aggregate rules as localrules, findings synthesis document.\n\n**Current state**: DAG clean for core target. density×ACT A_lens = 1.049 ± 0.063 (headline). Shear detected at 15-17σ. SPT 14% low (blocked on SPT team). 506-job cascade pending for generate_results_table (script provenance from evidence key rename + older changes).\n\n**What remains open**: NaMaster Gaussian as primary covariance (last-bandpower artifact), RR2 shear response correction (blocked on Margherita/Giulio), pol_conv EUCLID commit to shared dr1_cmbx repo (needs coordination), findings synthesis (living document).",

      "body": "## Catalog-based harmonic cross-spectrum estimator\n\nThe catalog estimator computes shear × CMB-κ cross-spectra directly from galaxy catalogs, bypassing pixelization entirely. It is the validation estimator — not production — living in `compute_catalog_cross_spectrum` (explorations.smk). Its agreement with the map estimator (median bandpower correlation 0.998) proves that map-making introduces no bias.\n\n### Construction\n\n`nmt.NmtFieldCatalog` takes galaxy positions and ellipticities directly:\n\n```python\nmake_catalog_field(\n    pos=[ra, dec],          # (2, N) in degrees, lonlat=True\n    weights=w,              # she_{method}_weight, shape (N,)\n    values=[e1, e2],        # she_{method}_e{1,2}_corrected\n    lmax=3000,              # config: cross_correlation.binning.lmax\n    spin=2,                 # shear\n    pol_conv=\"IAU\",         # Euclid native; no e2 flip\n)\n```\n\nBefore field creation, additive bias is subtracted per component: `e_i -= <e_i>_w` (weighted mean). The subtracted values are stored in evidence metadata (`c1_subtracted`, `c2_subtracted`).\n\nFiltering chain: `tom_bin_id == bin_id`, `weight > 0`, `.drop_nulls()`. Typical catalog size: 100k–500k galaxies per bin (from ~5M total RR2).\n\n### Covariance\n\n`NmtFieldCatalog.get_mask()` raises `ValueError` — NaMaster cannot access the implicit mask. This blocks both workspace caching and Gaussian covariance computation.\n\n**Solution**: build an auxiliary map-based `NmtField` from the same underlying shear maps. The auxiliary field is used only for the covariance workspace; the cross-spectrum itself comes from the catalog field. This is valid because the NaMaster Gaussian covariance depends on mask geometry and fiducial spectra, not on the measurement method.\n\n**Knox proxy** is also available as a diagnostic. For catalog fields, shape noise is computed directly from the weighted ellipticity variance: `σ²_e = np.average(e², weights=w)`, with effective number density `n_eff = (Σw)² / Σw² / Ω_cross`.\n\n### Workspace caching\n\nMap-based fields hash via `joblib.hash([field.get_mask(), field.spin])` → cached to `.nmt_workspaces/`. Catalog fields return `None` for the hash (no `get_mask()`) → workspace is computed fresh each run. This makes catalog jobs slower (~3-4 min vs ~1-2 min for map).\n\n### Polarization convention\n\nEuclid shear catalogs are in IAU convention natively. The `pol_conv=\"IAU\"` parameter tells NaMaster to handle the IAU→internal conversion transparently. No manual e2 flip is needed.\n\n### What the catalog estimator tests\n\nBy operating on galaxy positions and ellipticities without pixelization, it isolates map-making artifacts: HEALPix discretization, sparse FITS encoding, weight map construction, and mask edge effects. Agreement with the map estimator at the 0.2% level (r = 0.998) confirms that none of these introduce bias. The agreement is a strict consistency check — both estimators share the same CMB κ map, so the test is galaxy-side only.\n\n### Code path\n\n`cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_compute_cross_spectrum.py` lines 151–223 (catalog branch).

It computes cross-spectra from pixelized HEALPix maps via `nmt.NmtField` → pseudo-C_ℓ → mode-decoupled bandpowers. All production cross-spectra (shear × κ, density × κ) use this path.\n\n### Pipeline\n\n1. **Map building** (`catalog_to_map` rule): Euclid shear catalogs → sparse HEALPix FITS at nside=2048. Two maps per method per bin: e1, e2 components + weight map. Loaded via `nmt_utils.read_healpix_map()` which handles both dense and sparse FITS.\n\n2. **Masking** (`make_mask` / `make_shear_mask` / `make_convergence_mask`):\n   - Shear: `footprint(weight > 0) × weight_map` → C2 apodize at 0.15 rad. The continuous weight gradients produce visually smooth masks.\n   - Density: `footprint(mask > 0)` → C2 apodize at 0.15 rad. Binary input produces only a ~9 arcmin edge taper.\n   - CMB κ: ACT uses official apodized mask (downgraded from nside=4096); SPT uses winter mask with 3° cos² rolloff. Direct apodization via `nmt.mask_apodization()`.\n\n3. **Field construction** (`make_field`):\n   ```python\n   nmt.NmtField(mask, [e1, e2], spin=2, pol_conv=\"IAU\", lmax=3000, n_iter=1)\n   ```\n   Shear: spin-2 with IAU convention (Euclid native — no e2 flip). Density/convergence: spin-0. CMB κ: spin-0.\n\n4. **Cross-spectrum**: `nmt.compute_coupled_cell(euclid_field, cmbk_field)` → coupled pseudo-C_ℓ. Decoupled via workspace: `wksp.decouple_cell(pcl)`. Output: (2, nbins) for spin-2 × spin-0 [E-κ, B-κ], (1, nbins) for spin-0 × spin-0.\n\n5. **Binning**: Log-spaced, 20 bandpowers from ℓ=40 to ℓ=3000. Edges: `np.geomspace(40, 3000, 21)`.\n\n### Covariance\n\nNaMaster Gaussian approximation with theory + noise fiducial spectra:\n- Shear auto: `C_ℓ^{EE,theory} + σ²/n_eff` (shape noise from FITS header `NOISE_CL`)\n- CMB auto: `C_ℓ^{κκ,theory} + N_ℓ` (reconstruction noise from published curves)\n- Cross: `C_ℓ^{Eκ,theory}`\n\nSpin-2 × spin-0 covariance output is (2×nbins, 2×nbins) with EE/BB interleaved. Extracted via `extract_covariance_block(cov, nbins)` → `(nbins, nbins)` E-κ covariance.\n\nValidated against Knox formula: NaMaster/Knox ≈ 1.04 (density), ≈ 1.26 (shear). NaMaster is primary for all error bars.\n\n### Workspace caching\n\nWorkspaces hash via `joblib.hash([field.get_mask(), field.spin])` — symmetric in field order. Cached to `.nmt_workspaces/wksp_cl/{hash}.fits`. Persistent across runs, significantly faster (~1-2 min/job vs ~3-4 for catalog).\n\n### Code path\n\n`cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_compute_cross_spectrum.py` lines 224–340 (map branch).

Keep a long-lived foreground shepherd session per iteration (strictly no exit until 100%).\n2.

      "body": "Systematic negative B-mode excess at low ℓ in shear × κ cross-spectra. Two distinct features, both affecting all 6 tomographic bins and both shear methods (lensmc, metacal).\n\n### Feature 1: ℓ ≈ 84, both ACT and SPT\n\nNegative B-modes at 2.5–4.4σ (Knox) across bins 2–6 for both CMB experiments. Present in ACT and all four SPT estimators (GMV, TT, PP, MV). Since it appears in both CMB maps, the source is on the galaxy side — likely E→B leakage from partial-sky mode coupling. The overlap footprints are small (ACT∩Euclid 261 deg², SPT∩Euclid 115 deg²), making leakage significant at these scales.\n\nRepresentative values at ℓ=84 (lensmc, B/σ_Knox):\n- Bin 3: ACT −2.7, SPT GMV (not exceeding threshold at ℓ=84 specifically)\n- Bin 4: ACT −2.7\n- Bin 6: ACT −3.7, SPT GMV −3.7, SPT TT −4.4, SPT PP −3.6, SPT MV −3.9\n\n### Feature 2: ℓ ≈ 44, SPT-specific\n\nNegative B-modes at 2.5–4.3σ for bins 3–6, absent in ACT (ACT has |B/σ| < 1 at ℓ=44). Consistent across all four SPT estimators. Since SPT's overlap patch is smaller (fsky≈0.044), E→B leakage is expected to be more severe at the largest angular scales. Alternatively, this could be a large-scale systematic in the SPT winter κ reconstruction.\n\nRaw values at ℓ=44 (lensmc bin6, map estimator):\n- ACT: E=+2.3e-08, B=−1.3e-08 (−0.5σ)\n- SPT GMV: E=+1.9e-08, B=−7.5e-08 (−2.4σ)\n- SPT TT: E=+3.8e-09, B=−5.3e-08 (−1.5σ)\n- SPT PP: E=+2.4e-08, B=−8.5e-08 (−2.5σ)\n- SPT MV: E=+1.9e-08, B=−7.5e-08 (−2.4σ)\n\n### Key observation\n\n**All >2.5σ B-mode outliers are negative.** 56 excursions above 2.5σ across all bins/methods/experiments; every one is negative. Random scatter at this threshold would produce roughly equal positive and negative. This coherent sign points to a physical or geometric origin (E→B leakage produces a definite sign pattern depending on mask geometry).\n\n### Interpretation\n\nE→B leakage at partial sky is the leading explanation. NaMaster's pseudo-Cℓ formalism decouples E and B modes, but the decoupling is imperfect when fsky is small. Neither we, gctools, ACT×DES, nor DES×SPT use `purify_b=True`. ACT×DES (Qu+ 2023) used 511 sims for B-mode covariance instead of the NaMaster Gaussian approximation, which underestimates B-mode variance by 15–150× (see `namaster-gaussian-covariance-9373b1fa`).\n\nThe B-mode excess does NOT explain the shear non-detection — the E-mode signal itself is suppressed to ≈10% of theory, while B-modes at 10⁻⁸ are comparable to E-mode amplitudes (as expected from leakage at this sky fraction). The absence of E-mode signal is a separate problem.\n\n### Next steps\n\n- Confirm with `purify_b=True` run (expensive but diagnostic)\n- Compare B-mode amplitudes to the E→B leakage prediction from the coupling matrix\n- Note this in the methods discussion as a known limitation of partial-sky pseudo-Cℓ",
      "outcome": "Two features in shear x kappa B-mode cross-spectra, both from E->B leakage at partial sky (fsky 0.01-0.03):\n\n(1) ell~84 negative B-modes at 2.5-4.4sigma (Knox) across bins 2-6, BOTH ACT and SPT. Galaxy-side origin (both CMB maps see it). All four SPT estimators (GMV/TT/PP/MV) agree.\n\n(2) ell~44 negative B-modes at 2.5-4.3sigma for bins 3-6 in SPT only, absent in ACT (|B/sigma|<1). SPT's smaller fsky (0.044 vs 0.248) amplifies low-ell leakage.\n\nKey diagnostic: ALL 56 excursions above 2.5sigma are negative — coherent sign from mask geometry, not random scatter. B/E amplitude ratio 0.58-1.47 (B-modes comparable to E-modes, expected for E->B leakage at this sky fraction). NaMaster Gaussian BB covariance underestimates B-mode variance by 15-150x (does not capture leakage contributions). ACTxDES (Qu+ 2023) used 511 sims instead.\n\nDoes NOT explain the shear non-detection — E-mode signal itself is suppressed to ~10% of theory. The B-mode excess is a separate geometric effect from mask-induced mode coupling. Neither we, gctools, ACTxDES, nor DESxSPT use purify_b=True.",

No new files — all changes are edits to existing code.\n\n### Law 1: WL noise stored as scalar\n\n`process_wl_catalog` stores a **scalar** `noise_cl` (float) in the pickle, not an `nl_coupled` array. The array `(n_cls, lmax+1)` is built at the point of use — inside `map2cls` when consuming the WL pickle — using whatever `lmax` the current analysis requires.\n\n**Why:** The noise is white (flat in ℓ). Storing `(1, 3*nside)` bakes in a length that may not match the analysis `lmax`. A scalar is the natural representation of flat noise and eliminates shape mismatches.\n\n**Where:**\n- `maps.py`: `process_wl_catalog` — replace `nl_coupled = noise_cl * fsky * np.ones((1, 3*nside))` with storing the scalar `noise_cl` (and `fsky` if needed) directly\n- `spectra.py`: `map2cls` WL section (~line 1198) — build `nl_4 = np.zeros((4, lmax+1)); nl_4[0] = nl_4[3] = noise_scalar` from the stored scalar and the current `lmax`\n- Tests: update any test that references `nl_coupled` shape\n\n### Law 2: Verify workspace cache correctness\n\n`get_workspace` uses `_hash_fields` (masks + spins only) as cache key, then calls `update_bins()` on load. This is correct NaMaster usage IF `check_unbinned()` / `update_bins()` work as documented — the coupling matrix is bin-independent and binning is applied during decoupling.\n\n**Action:** Write a test that computes the same spectrum with two different binning schemes from the same cached workspace and verifies results match fresh (uncached) computation. If the test passes, the cache is correct and no hash change is needed. If it fails, add bins to the hash.\n\n### Law 3: Remove dead filename code\n\nDelete `_build_gc_filename` and `_exp_tag` from `spectra.py`. They are dead code — `map2cls` builds output filenames from input basenames (line ~1214). Remove their tests from `test_spectra.py` as well.\n\n### Law 4: Rename `Bbl` → `bpws`\n\nUnify on `bpws` throughout. Currently `get_spectrum` returns `\"bpws\"`, but `get_spectra` renames it to `\"Bbl\"` (line 806), and `pickle_spectra` reads `\"Bbl\"`. One name for one thing.\n\n**Where:** `get_spectra` (line 806), `pickle_spectra` (~line 930), any test referencing `\"Bbl\"`.\n\n### Law 5: Determine `nbin` from catalog data\n\n`gc_cat2map` line 177: `tom_ids = cat[\"pos_tom_bin_id\"].to_numpy(...) if nbin == 6 else np.ones_like(z, dtype=int)` — the `nbin == 6` gate is wrong. Read `pos_tom_bin_id` unconditionally (it's in the catalog regardless of how many bins we want) and let the downstream loop over `range(1, nbin+1)` select the relevant bins.\n\n**Where:** `maps.py` `gc_cat2map` (~line 177). Remove the `if nbin == 6` conditional.\n\n### Law 6: `extract_covariance_block` docstring\n\nUpdate the docstring to document all three cases: spin-0×spin-0 (n_cls=1, returns as-is), spin-2×spin-0 (n_cls=2, extracts Eκ block), spin-2×spin-2 (n_cls=4, extracts EE block). The code already handles all three correctly.\n\n### Law 7: `_hash_fields` — no silent error masking\n\nThe `except (ValueError, AttributeError)` clause is there for `NmtFieldCatalog` which raises on `get_mask()`. Narrow the catch: use `isinstance(f, nmt.NmtFieldCatalog)` to detect the catalog case explicitly and return `None` before attempting `get_mask()`. Let all other exceptions propagate. Nothing in this codebase should silently swallow errors.\n\n### Law 8: Common mask TODO\n\nAdd a comment in `map2cls` at the `common_mask` block (~line 1130):\n```python\n# TODO: common_mask binarizes all inputs before intersection.\n# For weighted (non-binary) masks, this discards weight information.\n# Consider whether weighted intersection is needed.\n```\n\n### Law 9: `wl_cat2map` integration test\n\nAdd a test that exercises the full `wl_cat2map` pipeline: construct a small polars DataFrame with the expected columns (`right_ascension`, `declination`, `e1_cal`, `e2_cal`, `weight`, `tom_bin_id`, `tile_index`), run `wl_cat2map`, and verify the output pickle has the correct structure and values. Model on the existing `gc_cat2map` test pattern but without monkeypatching `process_wl_catalog`.\n\n## Context\n\n- **Repo:** `code/dr1_cmbx/` on `maps_refactor` branch\n- **Key files:** `src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/spectra.py`, `src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/maps.py`, `tests/test_spectra.py`, `tests/test_maps.py`\n- **Test runner:** `cd code/dr1_cmbx && pip install -e . && pytest tests/ -q` (inside container or CI)\n- **NaMaster:** real NmtField objects at nside=8 in test fixture (`tests/conftest.py`). No mocking.\n\n## Skills\n\nActivate `/implementing-code` before working.\n\n## Evidence\n\n```bash\ncd /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083/cdaley00/cmbx/code/dr1_cmbx\n\n# All tests pass\nsingularity exec --bind /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083 /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083/cdaley00/container \\\n  bash -c \"cd /leonardo_work/EUHPC_E05_083/cdaley00/cmbx/code/dr1_cmbx && pip install -e . -q && pytest tests/ -q\"\n\n# Dead code is gone\ngrep -n '_build_gc_filename\\|_exp_tag' src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/spectra.py  # should return nothing\n\n# Bbl is gone\ngrep -rn 'Bbl' src/ tests/  # should return nothing\n\n# nbin == 6 gate is gone\ngrep -n 'nbin == 6' src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/maps.py  # should return nothing\n\n# nl_coupled array is gone from maps.py\ngrep -n 'nl_coupled.*ones' src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/maps.py  # should return nothing\n\n# noise stored as scalar\ngrep -n 'noise_cl' src/dr1_cmbx/eDR1data/maps.py  # scalar storage\n```\n\n## Open Questions\n\nNone — all items are decided.

Data at ℓ > 200 falls systematically below theory for high-z bins.\n\nNLA IA makes no difference (IA chi2 ≈ vanilla chi2 in every bin).\n\nPossible explanations:\n1. Shear calibration bias worsening with z (multiplicative m bias in photo-z bins)\n2. Shape noise estimation issue in high-z bins\n3. Theory n(z) mismatch (wrong effective redshift for high bins)\n4. E-mode leakage from B-modes (known to be large at fsky~0.1)\n5.

Meanwhile density × κ gives A_lens = 1.05 ± 0.06, confirming the pipeline works for spin-0.\n\n### Key questions\n\n1. **Does `she_{method}_e1_corrected` already include the shear response/calibration correction?** In standard metacal, `e_corrected` is the PSF-corrected ellipticity NOT divided by the shear response <R>. The true shear estimate requires γ = <e>/<R>. If this correction is missing, our cross-spectra are suppressed by <R>.\n\n2. **What is the expected value of <R> for this catalog?** For metacal with the RR2 resolution (r2/(r2+psf_r2) ≈ 0.74) and S/N (median 92), typical <R> should be 0.6-0.8. But our measured A ≈ 0.1 would require <R> ≈ 0.1, which seems inconsistent with well-resolved galaxies.\n\n3. **Has anyone measured shear 2-point statistics (γγ) from RR2?** The SHE validation talk (Sept 2025) mentions \"first unblinded cosmological constraints\" — if shear auto-power shows cosmological signal, the catalog does contain shear information and our issue is in the cross-correlation.\n\n4. **For lensmc**: The forward-modeling pipeline directly estimates the shear. Is `e_corrected` the raw model-fit ellipticity, or has it been calibrated? The talk shows |m| ~ 2×10⁻³ — but that's from sim comparison. Does the catalog value of e_corrected already fold in that correction?\n\n### Context\n\nAll calibration columns (m11/m12/m21/m22, c1/c2, weight_cal) are NaN for all 30.7M galaxies. We use `e1_corrected`, `e2_corrected` with `she_{method}_weight` directly.",

Run `pip install -e code/dr1_cmbx` or equivalent in the container.\n\n2. **Touch compute_cross_spectrum.py** — snakemake won't see library changes. Add a comment or trivial change to trigger script-hash rebuild.\n\n3. **Dry run** — `snakemake -n compute_all_shear_cross_spectra` should show all shear jobs need rebuilding. Also `compute_all_systematic_cross_spectra` (shear × systematic) needs rebuilding.\n\n4. **Run** — `snakemake-tmux -j20 compute_all_shear_cross_spectra compute_all_systematic_cross_spectra`\n\n5. **Verify** — Check A_lens for lensmc × ACT. Should recover to ≈ 1, not ≈ 0.\n\n6. **Cascade** — After shear xspec rebuild: combine rules, likelihood, plots, results table all need regeneration. Run the default target or `generate_results_table`.\n\n7. **Update fibers** — Close shear-non-detection fiber with revised outcome. Update findings synthesis. The \"11 ruled-out hypotheses\" were all correct — the bug was in the pol_conv machinery, not any of those.",

      "body": "Collaborators want shear and density maps stored as pickle to match the `dr1_cmbx` library format (`wl_cat2map()`/`gc_cat2map()`). Currently our pipeline writes sparse FITS via `write_sparse_map()` — one file per (method, bin). The migration matches the dr1_cmbx convention: one pickle per method, all bins nested inside. Also adds a `core` target for lean verification runs (~60 jobs instead of 500+).\n\n## Scope\n\n**Migrate to pickle**: Shear maps (build_maps.py), density maps (build_density_maps.py), jackknife null maps (build_jackknife_null_maps.py).\n\n**Keep as FITS**: Apodized masks (dense HEALPix, NaMaster idiom). External inputs (ACT/SPT/systematic maps).\n\n**Add core target**: maps + masks + cross-spectra + combine + likelihood = A_lens. Default snakemake target.\n\n## Pickle Format\n\nMatch dr1_cmbx `wl_cat2map()` structure. One pickle per method, all bins nested:\n\n```python\n# Shear: {method}_maps.pkl\n{\n    \"7bin\": {\n        \"bin0\": {  # 0-indexed to match dr1_cmbx\n            \"ipix\": np.array,        # sparse pixel indices (RING)\n            \"e1\": np.array,          # weighted mean shear per pixel\n            \"e2\": np.array,          # weighted mean shear per pixel\n            \"sum_weights\": np.array, # sum(w) per pixel\n            \"neff\": np.array,        # effective N per pixel\n            \"mask\": np.array,        # binary (all 1.0, sparse)\n            \"noise_cl\": float,       # flat shape noise\n            \"fsky\": float,\n            \"sigma_eps\": float,\n            \"sigma_eps_comp\": float,\n            \"n_eff_global\": float,\n            \"nmean_srad\": float,\n            \"c1_sub\": float,\n            \"c2_sub\": float,\n            \"pol_conv\": \"IAU\",\n        },\n        \"bin1\": {...},\n        ...\n        \"bin6\": {...},  # \"all\" bin stored as bin6 (last)\n    }\n}\n\n# Density: density_maps.pkl\n{\n    \"7bin\": {\n        \"bin0\": {\n            \"ipix\": np.array,\n            \"map\": np.array,      # overdensity delta (sparse)\n            \"mask\": np.array,     # binary mask (sparse)\n            \"n_gal\": int,\n            \"n_gal_sr\": float,\n            \"area_sr\": float,\n            \"shot_nl\": float,\n            \"nmean\": float,\n        },\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Read-Side: Inline pickle loads\n\nNo helper function — inline `pickle.load()` + sparse-to-dense, same as spectra.py line 1087:\n\n```python\ndata = pickle.load(open(pkl_path, \"rb\"))\nbin_key = next(k for k in data if k.endswith(\"bin\"))\nbd = data[bin_key][f\"bin{bin_idx}\"]\nnpix = hp.nside2npix(nside)\ne1 = np.zeros(npix); e1[bd[\"ipix\"]] = bd[\"e1\"]\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### Write side (3 scripts)\n1. `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_build_maps.py` — All bins in one invocation, single pickle.dump()\n2. `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_build_density_maps.py` — Same pattern\n3. `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_build_jackknife_null_maps.py` — Convert to pickle output\n\n### Rules (DAG structure changes)\n4. `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_maps.smk` — Remove {bin} wildcard from catalog_to_map and build_density_map\n5. `workflow/Snakefile` — get_euclid_map_files() returns pkl path + bin_id param.

Write-side scripts (build_maps.py, build_density_maps.py, build_jackknife_null_maps.py)\n2. Rules (maps.smk, Snakefile path functions, spectra.smk)\n3. Read-side scripts (compute_cross_spectrum.py first, then others)\n4. Core rule in Snakefile\n5. explorations.smk and remaining scripts\n6. Dry run core target\n7. Run core, verify A_lens\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `snakemake -n core` shows ~60 jobs\n2. Pickle structure matches dr1_cmbx: `python -c \"import pickle; d = pickle.load(open('path.pkl','rb')); print(d.keys())\"`\n3. A_lens ~ 1 for density x ACT (confirms pol_conv fix + pickle roundtrip)\n4. A_lens for shear x ACT (the big question — should recover from ~0)",

      "body": "Lovingly improve the early-to-mid tapestry: systematic contamination figures, signal overview, SPT estimator comparison. Polish plots to presentation quality for CMBX-SWG internal audience, and enrich fiber bodies with traceable, referenced descriptions. After plots are implemented, iterations should alternate between visual refinement and fiber content.\n\n## Desired State\n\n### Infrastructure: tapestry aggregate target\n\nA snakemake rule `tapestry` that collects ALL active `tapestry:`-tagged fiber rules into one target. Implementation: query `felt ls -t tapestry:` at DAG construction time or maintain a list in the Snakefile. When `snakemake tapestry` runs clean, the full tapestry is up to date.\n\n### 1. Contamination overview (X plot)\n`plot_contamination_overview` — 2×11 grid showing X^f_S per systematic map.\n\n- **Each subplot has its own title**: \"{Sysmap} × {Tracer}\" (e.g., \"Persistence × Galaxy density\"). No suptitle, no column headers.\n- **One y-axis label per row** on the left column only. Right column panels suppress the y-axis label.\n- **Figure dimensions computed from content**, not hardcoded. Margins (left, right, top, bottom) in inches, not figure fractions — so they scale correctly regardless of row count.\n- **lensmc vs metacal visually distinct**: BOTH linestyle (solid vs dashed) AND marker shape (circle vs square). Color encodes CMB experiment (ACT salmon, SPT teal from COLORS dict). So: lensmc×ACT = solid+circle+salmon, metacal×ACT = dashed+square+salmon, lensmc×SPT = solid+circle+teal, metacal×SPT = dashed+square+teal.\n- Legend in one panel (top-right) showing all curve styles.\n- Figure should be slightly narrower than current — `FW`-scale columns, not `FW + 0.5`.\n\n### 2. PTE heatmap (new figure)\nNew rule `plot_pte_heatmap`. Axes: sysmap (rows) × tomographic bin (columns), one panel per tracer×cmbk combination.\n\n- Colored by PTE from existing systematic null test evidence.\n- **Colormap**: `vlag` (diverging), `vmin=0, vmax=1`. To make failures pop: clip the colormap so that PTE < 0.05 maps to the extreme red and PTE > 0.95 maps to the extreme blue — i.e., the 0→0.05 and 0.95→1 tails are saturated flat color. Implementation: `matplotlib.colors.TwoSlopeNorm(vcenter=0.5, vmin=0, vmax=1)` with the vlag cmap, or manually build a clipped norm that compresses the tails. `set_bad(lightgray)` for missing. Reference: `sp_validation/src/sp_validation/b_modes.py:751-782` (uses vlag + contour at 0.05/0.95; adapt for heatmap).\n- Annotate each cell with PTE value (2 decimal places).\n- **Caveat in fiber and plot**: error bars are not yet validated — PTE pass/fail may reflect error bar mis-estimation rather than true contamination. Frame as \"preliminary diagnostic\" not \"verdict.\"\n- Data source: per-bin NPZ in `results/.../systematics/{sysmap}_x_{method}_bin{n}_cls.npz`. Look for `chi2_dof` and `pte` fields; if absent, compute from chi2 and dof inline using scipy.stats.chi2.sf.\n\n### 3. Systematic spectra (ingredient breakdowns)\n`plot_systematic_spectra` — one figure per sysmap (11 total), 3 panels: C^{fS}, C^{κS}, C^{SS}.\n\n- All methods overlaid per panel (already implemented). Verify styling matches contamination overview conventions (same colors, markers, linestyles for lensmc/metacal/density × ACT/SPT).\n- Consistent y-axis limits within each panel type across all 11 figures where possible.\n- Panel titles: \"Tracer × Sysmap\", \"CMB κ × Sysmap\", \"Sysmap auto-spectrum\".\n\n### 4. Signal overview (lower priority)\n`plot_signal_overview` — hero figure: ACT+SPT+theory per bin.\n\n- **Wider figure** — current aspect ratio squeezes the panels.\n- Rerun to pick up any upstream data changes since last generation.\n- Fiber body should be up to date with current A_lens values and detection significance.\n\n### 5. SPT estimator comparison (lower priority)\n`plot_spt_estimator_comparison` — currently shows ratio plots that are unreadable.\n\n- **Redesign**: use PP (polarization-only) as foreground-free baseline. Plot TT−PP and GMV−PP as difference spectra. This isolates the tSZ-sensitive component.\n- Clean up fiber body with current evidence (all 14 comparisons consistent, min PTE=0.981).\n\n### 6. Fiber bodies: systematic map descriptions\n\nEnrich the systematic map documentation with **referenced, attributed** descriptions of each map:\n\n- What does each map measure physically? (stellar density = Gaia star counts per pixel, galactic extinction = SFD98 E(B-V), etc.)\n- Why might it contaminate weak lensing or CMB lensing?\n- Conceptual groupings — rethink the current ordering. Possibilities: (a) astrophysical foregrounds (stellar density, galactic extinction, star brightness), (b) survey properties (exposures, noise, PSF, persistence), (c) environmental (zodiacal light, SAA), (d) derived (galaxy number density, photo-z quality). Find groupings that tell a story.\n- All claims traceable to source (DPDD in `docs/data-product-doc/`, Euclid papers, VMPZ-ID documentation).\n\nThese descriptions belong in the `systematic-maps-on-the-sky-83122c03` fiber body and/or a new doc fiber downstream of it. They feed into presentation narrative.\n\n### 7. Tapestry fiber currency\n\nAll fibers with `tapestry:` tags should have:\n- Bodies that describe what the figure shows and why it matters\n- Outcomes that summarize key findings with numbers\n- Up-to-date evidence in `results/claims/{specName}/`\n\nCheck each `tapestry:`-tagged fiber (run `felt ls -t tapestry:`) and update stale ones. Disabled nodes (`tapestry-disabled:`) are lower priority but should be checked for obvious staleness.\n\n## Skills\n\nActivate before relevant work:\n- `/snakemake` — before any snakemake operations\n- `/data-visualization` — for non-trivial plot design choices\n- `/tapestry` — when updating fiber bodies or evidence\n- `/felt` — at end of each iteration\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Max 5 sub-fibers per iteration.** File decisions and questions, keep the graph tight.\n- **All plot rules are localrules** (read pre-computed NPZ, produce matplotlib). No SLURM needed for plots.\n- **Fix what you find.** If a compute script has a bug, or upstream data is stale, fix the code and rerun through snakemake. The goal is correct, presentation-ready output — not avoiding upstream changes. Trust the DAG: if changing a script triggers 200 reruns, run them (`-j20`). File what you changed as a fiber.\n- **Plotting standards**: `setup_theme()`, `COLORS/MARKERS/LABELS/SYSMAP_LABELS` from `plot_utils.py`, `save_evidence()` for every figure.\n- **LaTeX in matplotlib**: `text.usetex: True` works in container. All rendered strings must use LaTeX syntax (no raw Unicode σ, ×, κ).\n- Visualization and documentation are the primary focus, but fix upstream problems when you find them.\n- **PTE heatmap caveat**: error bars are unvalidated. Don't frame pass/fail as definitive.\n- **After plots are implemented**, subsequent iterations should improve both plot styling AND fiber bodies. Don't just code — write.\n\n## Context\n\n- Scripts: `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_contamination_overview.py`, `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_systematic_spectra.py`, `cmbx/files/workflow_scripts_plot_signal_overview.py`, `workflow/scripts/plot_spt_estimator_comparison.py`\n- Rules: `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_explorations.smk`, `cmbx/files/workflow_rules_tapestry.smk`\n- Style: `plot_utils.py` — `FW=4.0`, `COLORS`, `MARKERS`, `LABELS`, `SYSMAP_LABELS`\n- Evidence: `results/claims/{specName}/`\n- Systematic NPZ: `results/rr2_v2_1_wl_031224-v0.0/cross_correlations/systematics/` and `.../cmbk_systematics/`\n- PTE reference: `sp_validation/src/sp_validation/b_modes.py:751-782`\n- Tapestry fibers: `felt ls -t tapestry:` (active nodes), `felt ls -t tapestry-disabled:` (disabled)\n- DPDD: `docs/data-product-doc/`\n- Contamination pyramid: `felt show contamination-pyramid-37cb020a`\n- Plotting standards: `felt show plotting-standards-57ba2ceb`\n- Systematic maps doc: `felt show systematic-maps-on-the-sky-83122c03`\n\n## Progress (from previous iterations)\n\nFirst 9 iterations achieved the basic implementation. All figures exist and run. Tapestry aggregate target works. Spine fibers updated. But the user hasn't reviewed the visual output yet — **the work now is refinement, not implementation**. Survey the plots (open the PNGs), improve styling, tighten fiber prose, iterate on artistry. Don't close this fiber until the user reviews.\n\n## Evidence\n\n- `snakemake -n tapestry` — aggregate target exists and is clean\n- Visual: open PNG outputs and inspect for clipping, overlap, readability\n- `felt ls -t tapestry:` — all active nodes have non-empty bodies and up-to-date outcomes\n- All tapestry rule outputs exist in `results/claims/`",
